1	1	Accidental shooting	A Security Guard Who Stopped A Gunman At A Bar Was Shot And Killed By Responding Police	BuzzFeed News	https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maryanngeorgantopoulos/security-guard-illinois-bar-police-shot-killed-gun	 A security guard at an Illinois bar was shot and killed early Sunday by a police officer who arrived at the scene following reports of a shooting.Jemel Roberson, 26, was shot by a Midlothian police officer who arrived at Manny's Blue Room Lounge in Robbins, Illinois, around 4 am on Sunday.According to a statement by Midlothian Police Department Chief Daniel Delaney, officers who arrived at the scene "learned there were several gunshot victims inside the bar.""Officers encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an Officer involved shooting," the statement, which does not identify the police officer, said.One witness told WGN9 that a drunk patron who was asked to leave the bar returned with a gun and opened fire inside.According to witnesses who spoke to local reporters, Roberson apprehended the suspect until police arrived."I guess when the police got there, they probably thought he was one of the bad guys, cause he had his gun on the guy and they shot him," Harris told Fox32.Roberson played music at the Purposed Church in Chicago for the past several years, according to Pastor LeAundre Hill, who tweeted that Roberson "had just played for my grandma's funeral Friday and now he's gone."
2	1	Accidental Shooting	A black security guard caught a shooting suspect - only to be shot by police minutes later	Vox	https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/11/12/18088874/jemel-roberson-police-shooting-security-guard-illinois	 In the early hours of November 11, 26-year-old Jemel Roberson was working security at a bar in the Chicago suburbs when a shooting broke out.Shortly after Roberson subdued the suspect at gunpoint, police arrived - and fatally shot the armed security guard as he pinned the suspect to the ground.In preliminary findings released on Tuesday, Illinois State Police (which is tasked with investigating the shooting) argued that the officer gave Roberson "multiple verbal commands" to drop his weapon before opening fire.Gregory Kulis, a lawyer representing Roberson's mother in a civil rights lawsuit filed after the shooting, said that Roberson had a hat with the words "SECURITY" on it.News of Roberson's shooting comes amid a national conversation about racial disparities in police violence, and how it affects black men and women.Coverage of Roberson's shooting has focused on exactly how long it took the officer to use his weapon after he arrived at the scene, and what commands, if any, were made before he opened fire.Witness statements provided to media have suggested that the officer involved in the shooting did not react to cries that Roberson was a security guard.But the statement from the state police argues that the responding officer had no way to know Roberson was security and that he only fired after Roberson did not respond to commands. Patricia Hill, another pastor at Purposed Church, said that Roberson wanted to become a police officer, calling it a tragedy that he was killed in a police shooting.
