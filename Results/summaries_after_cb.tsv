2	Jemel Roberson, 26, was shot by a Midlothian police officer who arrived at Manny's Blue Room Lounge in Robbins, Illinois, around 4 am on Sunday.According to a statement by Midlothian Police Department Chief Daniel Delaney, officers who arrived at the scene "learned there were several gunshot victims inside the bar."According to witnesses who spoke to local reporters, Roberson apprehended the suspect until police arrived."I guess when the police got there, they probably thought he was one of the bad guys, cause he had his gun on the guy and they shot him," Harris told Fox32.Roberson played music at the Purposed Church in Chicago for the past several years, according to Pastor LeAundre Hill, who tweeted that Roberson "had just played for my grandma's funeral Friday and now he's gone."
3	 Shortly after Roberson subdued the suspect at gunpoint, police arrived - and fatally shot the armed security guard as he pinned the suspect to the ground.When officers from the Robbins and Midlothian police departments arrived, one officer opened fire, killing Roberson.In preliminary findings released on Tuesday, Illinois State Police (which is tasked with investigating the shooting) argued that the officer gave Roberson "multiple verbal commands" to drop his weapon before opening fire.Gregory Kulis, a lawyer representing Roberson's mother in a civil rights lawsuit filed after the shooting, said that Roberson had a hat with the words "SECURITY" on it.But the statement from the state police argues that the responding officer had no way to know Roberson was security and that he only fired after Roberson did not respond to commands.Dorian Myrickes, a colleague of Roberson's and one of the people injured in the initial gunfight, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that he did not hear the police officer issue any commands.Roberson's death is the latest incident in recent years where a black gun owner was fatally shot by police.Patricia Hill, another pastor at Purposed Church, said that Roberson wanted to become a police officer, calling it a tragedy that he was killed in a police shooting.
4	Investigators said 26-year-old Jemel Roberson was pronounced dead shortly after being taken to a hospital following the shooting early on Sunday at Manny's Blue Room in Robbins, just south of Chicago.Four other people were shot and wounded during the incident, including a man who police believe fired a gun before police arrived, the Cook county sheriff's spokeswoman, Sophia Ansari, said.When police arrived at the scene, Roberson was holding "somebody on the ground with his knee in his back, with his gun in his back," witness Adam Harris told WGN-TV.The other four people who were shot suffered wounds that were not considered life-threatening, Ansari said.Roberson was working to "enough money together for a deposit on a new apartment", said Hunter, the great uncle of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager fatally shot in 2014 by a white Chicago police officer.Illinois state police are handling the investigation into Roberson's shooting.
5	 When police arrived after reports of a shooting over the weekend at a bar outside Chicago, witnesses say Jemel Roberson, a 26-year-old security guard who worked there, had already subdued the alleged assailant in the parking lot, pinning him to the ground.Adam Harris, who was at Manny's Blue Bar in Robbins at the time of the incident on Sunday, told WGN-TV that Roberson was holding "somebody on the ground with his knee in his back, with his gun in his back" when officers from neighboring Midlothian got there early Sunday.Midlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney said that's when one of his officers "encountered a subject with a gun" and shot him, according to a statement given to the media.On Tuesday, Illinois State Police issued a statement saying that "a Midlothian Police Officer encountered a subject in plain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a Security Guard, armed with a gun in the west parking lot."Other witnesses, and a lawsuit filed by Roberson's family, reportedly said he was wearing a hat emblazoned with the word "security."Another witness, Jakia Woods, told member station WBEZ's Miles Bryan that Roberson was wearing an orange vest and the hat marked "security."Roberson's family filed a lawsuit on Monday against the Midlothian police department and the officer who shot him, seeking damages of $1 million.
6	 An armed security guard at a bar in suburban Chicago was killed by police as he detained a suspected gunman, according to officials and witnesses.After gunfire erupted around 04:00 local time on Sunday, Jemel Roberson, 26, chased down an attacker and knelt on his back until police arrived.Sophia Ansari, a spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's office, said police were called to the scene after a fight broke out in the bar and four people were shot."Everybody was screaming out 'security, he was a security guard'", Mr Harris added, "and they still did their job and saw a black man with a gun and basically killed him".
7	 A black security guard at a bar in the Chicago suburbs was killed by the police as he apparently tried to detain a man he believed to be involved in a shooting, the authorities said Monday.Officers from several police departments had responded to reports of a shooting early Sunday morning at Manny's Luxury Lounge in Robbins, Ill., said Sophia Ansari, a spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's Office.After the authorities responded, a police officer shot the guard, Jemel Roberson, 26, who had a gun, Ms. Ansari said.Witnesses said that people in the crowd had yelled to arriving police officers that Mr Roberson, who was wearing gear that read "Security," was a guard.The shooting of Mr Roberson is being investigated by the Illinois State Police, who did not return a call for comment.Family friends of Mr Roberson's said he had worked as an organist at several local churches and had once dreamed of becoming a police officer himself, according to local news reports.Mr Roberson had a state firearm owner's identification card, Ms. Ansari said, which authorized his possession of firearms.
8	 A police officer mistakenly shot and killed a security guard at a bar in Chicago's south suburbs early Sunday morning, Chicago's Fox 32 reported.Witnesses said a security guard told a group of "drunk men" to leave a Robbins bar around 4 am An armed suspect later came back inside the bar and opened fire, WGN-TV reported, citing witnesses.Roberson then requested help from Midlothian Police, the Cook County Sheriff's Office said.A witness told the station that Roberson was holding the suspect on the ground when one of two responding officers fatally shot him.The Cook County Sheriff's Office is investigating the first shooting, while the State Police Public Integrity Task Force is investigating the police shooting.
9	 A police officer fatally shot an armed security guard who was wearing a hat with "security" emblazoned across the front and holding a man down following a shooting inside the suburban Chicago bar where the guard worked, an attorney for the guard's family said Monday after filing a federal lawsuit.Four others were shot and wounded, including a man who police believe fired a gun before police arrived, Cook County sheriff's spokeswoman Sophia Ansari said.When police arrived at the scene, Roberson was holding "somebody on the ground with his knee in his back, with his gun in his back," witness Adam Harris told WGN-TV.Investigators said the initial gunfire was reported around 4 am An officer responding from nearby Midlothian encountered and shot "a subject with a gun," Midlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney said in a statement.Attorney Gregory Kulis filed a civil rights lawsuit seeking more than $1 million on behalf of Roberson's mother, Beatrice Roberson.He said Jemel Roberson was dressed in black but wearing a hat with the word "security" when he was shot.
10	The 26-year-old guard, Jemel Roberson, had restrained a thug involved in the shooting outside Manny's Blue Room in Robbins, Ill., after gunfire broke out at 4 am Sunday, according to local station Fox32.But cops who rushed to the bar mistook the guard for "one of the bad guys," witness Adam Harris told Fox32.Roberson tackled one of the men and held him on the ground as he waited for cops to arrive, Harris said."The security guard that got killed, he caught somebody and had his knee on him the whole time," Harris told Fox32.I guess when the police got there, they probably thought he was one of the bad guys, 'cause he had his gun on the guy and they shot him," he said.
11	 Rick Scott's campaign filed a handful of lawsuits seeking to give law enforcement custody of election equipment and prevent certain ballots from being included in official results.Scott accused Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections in Broward County, of violating state law by refusing to provide information to his campaign about the number of outstanding ballots.He also alleged Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County, had run afoul of state law by duplicating and damaging certain ballots.In a separate suit against Snipes, Scott's campaign asked a judge to block Broward County from counting any of the ballots it didn't include in the unofficial results it submitted to the Florida Department of State by noon Saturday, a deadline set by state law.Florida accepts vote-by-mail ballots until 7 pm on Election Day and the county may not have them all counted by Saturday's deadline."In suing to seize ballots and impound voting machines, Rick Scott is doing his best to impersonate Latin American dictators who have overthrown Democracies in Venezuela and Cuba," Penalosa said.Bucher, the Palm Beach County election official, told CNN it would be "impossible" for her staff to meet the state's deadline for recounting the votes.Nelson's campaign also has a lawsuit seeking to force the state to count ballots thrown out because the signature on them didn't match the one on file with the state's voter registration. The state law enforcement agency said Friday it wasn't investigating any allegations of fraud, but Scott continued to insist in a television interview on Fox News Sunday that such fraud existed.
12	 The two marquee races in Florida remain so tight they are officially headed toward a recount, the state secretary of state, Ken Detzner-an appointee of current Florida governor and Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott-announced Saturday.As the state begins its second tally, the original count in the Senate race gives Scott an ever-so-slim 12,500-vote lead of 8 million votes cast over Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson.The recounts seemed inevitable as the races tightened in the aftermath of Tuesday's vote and became a certainty after the noon deadline Saturday for county election supervisors to submit their results passed with both races within the 0.5 percent margin that legally mandates a recount.In the governor's race, which stands at a 0.4 percent margin, a legally required machine recount will be undertaken.In the Senate race, because it's closer than 0.25 percent, an additional hand recount is required by law of votes that were not initially counted by the voting machines for whatever reason.The machine recount must be completed by Thursday at 5 pm "In Broward and Palm Beach counties Saturday morning, attorneys from both parties quibbled over ballots in which the intent or eligibility of the voter was in doubt as the minutes ticked toward a noon deadline," the Washington Post reports. The Florida Department of State has sent monitors to Broward County, which had tallied more than 700,000 votes as of Thursday afternoon, stemming from a lawsuit over the county's mishandling of 2016 congressional race ballots.Further complicating matters in the Senate race is a potential ballot design flaw that may have caused tens of thousands of voters to skip over the Senate contest in Broward County, which was buried underneath the ballot instructions.Roughly 10,000 fewer people voted in Broward County in the Senate race than for the commissioner of agriculture or the chief financial officer race, which is unusual.
13	Earlier today, Ken Detzner, Florida's Secretary of State, announced that the state was doing a recount via machine.This part of the process has to be wrapped up by Thursday, at 3 pm Additionally, if races come within a .25 percent margin, those votes trigger a recount by hand.Georgia and Arizona are also fighting to get every vote counted, with particular attention on Stacey Abrams, who has yet to concede to former Secretary of State Brian Kemp in Georgia's battle for governor.It's also a big deal on a symbolic level, as President Donald Trump seems to think not every vote matters, as shown by his snark on Twitter: "You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia - but the Election was on Tuesday?
14	 Florida began the first full, statewide vote recount in its history on Saturday after authorities found that tallies submitted by its 67 counties left the contests for Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner too close to call.Recounts were also ordered in a State Senate race and two contests for the State House, a measure of the slender margins in the nation's largest swing state that have left two of the most closely watched races in the country still undecided, four days after the midterm elections.The sight of grim-faced candidates, shouting protesters outside the Broward County elections office and lawyers flown in from Washington evoked memories of Florida's hotly contested recount over the 2000 presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore and capped off one of the most bitterly divisive midterm election seasons in years.In Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema, the Democratic candidate in the state's uncalled Senate race, expanded her lead on Friday to 20,203 votes over Martha McSally, the Republican contender - and thousands of ballots were still to be counted.Mr Scott, who has filed lawsuits against elections officials in Broward and Palm Beach Counties over the handling of ballots, made it clear he was not expecting to relinquish the seat he claimed on Tuesday night and suggested the latest results filed on Saturday had reconfirmed it. Daniel A Smith, chairman of the political science department at the University of Florida, said 41,000 Floridians requested mail-in ballots from overseas, so elections supervisors were simply inundated with ballots to count after Election Day.Mr Scott claimed fraud in Broward County even though the state was monitoring Dr Snipes's office during the election.The odds that Mr Gillum, who trails by 0.41 percentage points, and even Mr Nelson, who is behind by about 0.15 percentage points, will find themselves on top after a recount seem low, according to veterans of Florida's presidential recount in 2000.Marc Elias, Mr Nelson's lawyer, has maintained that a machine error might still account for fewer votes for Mr Nelson - an issue that would only be caught in a manual recount.
15	 Florida has ordered a machine recount of votes for state governor and senator following last week's closely fought mid-term elections, officials say.Mr Detzner has ordered that all 67 Florida counties complete machine recounts for the Senate and gubernatorial races by 15:00 local time on Thursday.In the race for Florida's Senate seat, unofficial results revealed a gap of just 0.15% between the votes for incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson and Mr Scott.Mr Scott, who claimed victory on Tuesday, is suing officials over an election recount, while Mr Nelson is suing over uncounted ballots - and there have also been a number of protests outside the elections office.In one of his three lawsuits against election overseers, Mr Scott has asked a judge to impound voting machines and ballots when they are not in use.Mr Trump told reporters on Friday, before leaving for Paris to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, that he believed that Mr Scott had clearly won the election.Mr Gore's fate was finally sealed by a US Supreme Court ruling that said in essence that time had run out for recounts in the crucial state, granting Mr Bush the presidency.Mr Kemp declared victory on Wednesday with a narrow lead but campaign officials for Ms Abrams have started a legal challenge to ensure all votes are counted.
16	 Florida's Senate and governor's races have gone to a recount that will decide two key offices in the largest US swing state, setting off outcries from Republicans led by President Donald Trump and Rick Scott, the state's governor now vying to be a US Senator.In the Senate race, the unofficial count had Republican Scott leading incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson by about 12,600 votes among roughly 8.2 million votes cast in the Nov 6 election.Election workers on Saturday evening started a mad dash to recount by machine the millions of votes, in a task that some thought would be impossible to finish by the mandated deadline of 3 pm on Nov 15.Scott's "own Republican officials in Florida said there is no fraud," Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on CNN Sunday.Scott declared victory on election night, but slow vote-counting in Democrat-leaning Broward and Palm Beach counties narrowed the race to within the margin that dictates a recount.Trump, Scott and other Republicans have attempted to sow doubt about the process and raise suspicions about electoral officials, especially Broward County's election supervisor Brenda Snipes, who oversaw the vote in the state's second-most populous county, which includes Fort Lauderdale and Coral Springs. The 2000 presidential election was decided when the US Supreme Court halted a Florida recount and made Republican George W Bush the winner over Democrat Al Gore.In addition to more sophisticated voting technology, the Florida Election Reform Act of 2001 created a mechanism to automatically trigger a recount within a certain threshold.The race for Florida's agriculture commissioner will go to a recount as well, with Democrat Nikki Fried now edging Republican Matt Caldwell by about 5,300 votes.
17	 Florida Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott insisted Monday he "won the election" while accusing incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of trying to "steal" the race from him, amid chaotic recounts in the sunshine state's Senate and gubernatorial races.Over the weekend, Florida's secretary of state Ken Detzner announced there would be recounts in both the Senate race and the governor's race, noting that unofficial results in both races fell within the margin that by law triggers a recount.Scott, who is Florida's outgoing Republican governor, filed two bombshell lawsuits against election officials in two Democratic strongholds in Florida-Broward County and Palm Beach County-flagging them for engaging in potentially "rampant fraud."In the Florida governor's race, Republican candidate Ron DeSantis was announced the winner by the end of Election Day, with his Democratic opponent Andrew Gillum conceding on the night of the election."The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged.Florida Department of State spokeswoman Sarah Revell told Fox News, though, that under state law, if a county does not submit their results by the deadline, then the results on file at the time take their place. The Abrams campaign's lawsuit asked a judge to delay vote certifications in Georgia's unsettled governor's race by one day, and block counties from tossing some provisional and absentee ballots that may have minor mistakes on them."Kyrsten has now expanded her overall lead to 32,640 or 1.52 percent, meaning McSally would have to win the remainder of Maricopa ballots by 22 percent to take the lead in this race," Sinema spokesman Andrew Piatt said in a statement.
18	 Florida authorities on Saturday ordered a statewide recount in the contentious races for US Senate and governor, amid tit-for-tat accusations of fraud from the candidates - plunging the state once again into election uncertainty.Eighteen years after the Sunshine State found itself at the heart of a battle for the US presidency, it was once again in the spotlight after Tuesday's vote, which left the contests for statewide offices undecided.State law triggers a machine recount if the difference in a race is within 0.5 percent.After the cut-off, the Senate race between outgoing Republican governor Rick Scott and incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson was super close: Scott's lead stood at just 12,562 votes out of nearly 8.2 million cast, a margin of just 0.15 percent.In the governor's race, the latest unofficial results on the Florida division of elections website show Republican Ron DeSantis, who was backed by Donald Trump, leading Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum by just 33,684 votes out of more than 8.2 million cast, or a margin of 0.41 percent.In a statement, Detzner said the results of the machine recount would be due on November 15 at 3:00 pm (2000 GMT)."Bad things are going on in Broward Country, really bad things," Trump added, referring to a Democrat-heavy county where officials were slowly counting votes including absentee and provisional ballots. The recount is reminiscent of the dramatic recounts that occurred in parts of Florida after the 2000 presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore.Those recounts were halted by the US Supreme Court, and Bush defeated Gore by 537 votes in Florida to win the presidency.
19	 Florida election officials ordered statewide ballot recounts Saturday as ferocious battles over vote tallies left Senate and governor's races there in doubt.Unofficial vote totals submitted today at noon gave Republican Ron DeSantis a 0.4 percent edge over Democrat Andrew Gillum in the governor's race, triggering an automatic machine recount under state law.Rick Scott's advantage over incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson in the fight for a seat in the US Senate was just 0.15 percent - 12,562 votes out of nearly 8.2 million cast.If the machine recount yields a margin of victory less than 0.25 percent, state law requires Florida to conduct a hand recount that could take weeks.In a statement issued shortly after the provisional totals were released, Scott urged Nelson to concede."Bill Nelson's lawyer Marc Elias has previously stated that margins smaller than ours are 'insurmountable,'" Scott's campaign said.
20	Earlier, he had suggested that he supported far-right nationalism but believed that President Trump was captive to a Jewish conspiracy.American history has been marked by acts of anti-Semitic violence, including the shootings at Jewish community centers in Kansas City, in 2014, and Los Angeles, in 1999.It has been marked, too, by mass murders in houses of worship-in recent years, the massacre of twenty-six people at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, last November, and the murder of nine African-American worshippers at Emanuel AME Church, in Charleston, South Carolina, by the white supremacist Dylann Roof.On Wednesday afternoon, a man named Gregory Bush allegedly shot and killed two African-American customers at a Kroger's supermarket in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, reportedly saying afterward, "Whites don't kill whites."But the massacres in Pittsburgh and Jeffersontown-and the pipe bombs sent to a dozen Democratic leaders this week, allegedly by the Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc-share some obvious common causes.
21	 itic slurs opened fire inside a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday morning, killing at least 11 congregants and wounding four police officers and two others, the authorities said.The assailant, identified by law enforcement officials as Robert D Bowers, fired for several minutes and was leaving the synagogue when officers, dressed in tactical gear and armed with rifles, met him at the door.He also faces state charges, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation.Pittsburgh residents embraced near Tree of Life Congregation after the shooting.Calling it the "most horrific crime scene" he had seen in 22 years with the FBI, Robert Jones, special agent in charge in Pittsburgh, said the synagogue was in the midst of a "peaceful service" when congregants were gunned down and "brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith."Last November, a gunman killed 26 worshipers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., and in 2015, a white supremacist killed nine congregants in a church in Charleston, SC It came amid rising anxiety about illegal immigration and in a decade that has seen an uptick in hate crimes.Police dispatchers received the first emergency calls at 9:54 am, Mr Jones of the FBI said, and police officers, including a SWAT team, were dispatched a minute later. He went back into the synagogue to hide from SWAT officers who were moving in, Mr Jones said.Ben Opie, 55, who can see the synagogue from his backyard, said his wife was about to leave their house to do some volunteer work when SWAT officers approached their home and said there was a gunman in the synagogue.Representative Mike Doyle, who represents Pennsylvania's 14th District, where the synagogue is, said that Mr Bowers had 21 guns registered to his name.
22	Squirrel Hill has one of the largest Jewish populations in Pennsylvania and this would have been the synagogue's busiest day of the week.Pittsburgh's Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich later confirmed Mr Bowers was in police custody and was being treated in hospital.Pittsburgh FBI's special agent in charge of the investigation, Bob Jones, told a press conference that Mr Bowers did not appear to be known to authorities prior to events on Saturday.Mr Trump has also said that the incident had "little to do" with US gun laws.The BBC's Dan Johnson in Washington says the shootings come at a tense time in the US, after a week in which mail bombs were sent to critics of Mr Trump, ahead of crucial mid-term elections next month.
23	 The man accused of killing 11 Jews in an anti-Semitic attack at a Pittsburgh synagogue was charged in a 44-count indictment that includes federal hate crimes.Suspect Robert Bowers, 46, "made statements indicating his desire to 'kill Jews'" in the shooting attack on Saturday, the Department of Justice said in its indictment Wednesday.The charges include 11 counts of obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and 11 counts of use and discharge of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence.Grieving family, friends and neighbors of the 11 people gunned down at the Tree of Life synagogue meanwhile continued Wednesday with a series of funerals.Friends and family gathered at separate funerals to remember Joyce Fienberg, 75, Irving Younger, 69, and Melvin Wax, 88, who were among the 11 worshippers gunned down. After visiting the synagogue, the president and first lady went to a hospital where they met police officers who were wounded in the attack and medical staff.
24	 A gunman who's believed to have spewed anti-Semitic slurs and rhetoric on social media barged into a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday and opened fire, killing 11 people in one of the deadliest attacks on Jews in US history.The 20-minute attack at Tree of Life Congregation in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood left six others wounded, including four police officers who dashed to the scene, authorities said.The killings also immediately reignited the longstanding national debate about guns: President Donald Trump said the outcome might have been different if the synagogue "had some kind of protection" from an armed guard, while Pennsylvania's Democratic Gov.The survivors included Daniel Leger, 70, a nurse and hospital chaplain who was in critical condition after undergoing surgery, his brother, Paul Leger, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.Bob Jones, head of the FBI's Pittsburgh office, said that worshippers "were brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith," though he cautioned the shooter's full motive was not yet known."Our hearts break for the families of those killed and injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and for the entire Jewish community of Pittsburgh," Greenblatt said. The synagogue is located in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of Pittsburgh's Jewish community.Eisenberg, the former synagogue president, said officials at Tree of Life had not gotten any threats that he knew of before the shooting.
25	Police spokesman Chris Togneri said that a suspect is in custody after being taken to the hospital, adding that there are "multiple casualties inside the synagogue."Multiple law enforcement sources told local CBS affiliate KDKA and CNN that the gunman had been identified as Robert Bowers, 46.KDKA reported that eight people had been killed and others were wounded, including the officers who exchanged gunfire with the gunman.Tom Wolf (D) wrote on Twitter that he was heading to the synagogue in Squirrel Hill, adding state police were assisting local law enforcement.Police sources told KDKA that the suspected shooter made an anti-Semitic remark upon beginning the attack, shouting "all Jews must die" as he entered the building and opened fire.
26	 Eleven people were killed Saturday morning during a mass-shooting at The Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that ended in the arrest of a single suspect, Robert Bowers, and the recovery of multiple weapons."Anyone who does a thing like this to innocent people _ they should really pay the ultimate price," Mr Trump told reporters prior to heading to a farming event in Indiana."This is the most horrific crime scene I've seen in 22 years," echoed Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge at the bureau's Pittsburgh office, adding that 11 people were "brutally murdered by a gunman simply targeting them because of their faith."The Tree of Life Synagogue reported an active shooting situation at 9:54 am Saturday morning, and law enforcement officers were dispatched within seconds, Mr Hissrich said at a press conference.Law enforcement officials engaged the suspect upon arriving, and two police officers and two SWAT officers were among the six victims who suffered non-fatal injuries, Mr Hissrich added.Police arrested the suspect around 20 minutes after the first shots were fired and subsequently recovered weapons including an assault rifle and three handguns, Mr Jones told reporters. Located in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of eastern Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's second largest city, The Tree of Life Synagogue hosts weekly services every Saturday morning, according to its website.
27	burst into a Pittsburgh synagogue during Sabbath services, shooting and killing at least 11 people and wounding a half-dozen more, including four police officers, before surrendering.The conservative Tree of Life Synagogue had been packed with three separate congregations attending Saturday morning services when the bloodbath began at around 10 am  Congregants told MSNBC that a bris, or circumcision ceremony had been in progress.Pennsylvania's Attorney General Josh Shapiro said the shooting happened during the portion of the ceremony when the child is given a Hebrew name.The suspect - identified by CBS affiliate KDKA as 46-year-old Robert Bowers, a bearded, heavyset resident of Pittsburgh - was armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle and two handguns, according to multiple reports.He had an active license to carry a firearm, law enforcement sources told CNN, and was known to have made at least six firearm purchases since 1996.The gunfire sent congregants scattering, with many calling police after barricading themselves inside the building, located in the city's Jewish enclave Squirrel Hill.One of the worst that I've seen, and I've been on some plane crashes," Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters.He railed against HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a Jewish non-profit that advocates for refugees worldwide.
28	 The shooting rampage Saturday in a Pittsburgh synagogue that claimed 11 lives has been blamed on a man who authorities say spoke of "his desire to kill Jewish people."In a 12-page criminal complaint, police say they received multiple calls at 9:54am Saturday (1354 GMT) of gunshots being fired in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh's heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood.The first two officers on the scene exchanged fire with a suspect carrying an assault-style AR-15 rifle and three Glock handguns, said FBI special agent Bob Jones.Two other officers were among the six people injured in the grisly attack.The suspect, named as 46-year-old Robert Bowers, is being charged with 29 federal violations, including 22 carrying the death penalty, and multiple state offenses.Bowers, who reportedly worked as a long-haul trucker, has been linked to a rash of virulent anti-Semitic posts on social media, including one shortly before the attack that described Jews as "invaders" and said "I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered."The criminal complaint said Bowers told a SWAT agent that "he wanted all Jews to die.""Bowers is charged with killing eight men and three women, aged 54 to 97, all from the Pittsburgh area.David and Cecil Rosenthal were brothers, and Sylvan and Bernice Simon are husband and wife, Williams said.
