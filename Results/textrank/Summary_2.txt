Shortly after Roberson subdued the suspect at gunpoint, police arrived- and fatally shot the armed security guard as he pinned the suspect to the ground. Security returned fire and Roberson detained the man. When officers from the Robbins and Midlothian police departments arrived, one officer opened fire, killing Roberson. The shooting also calls attention to the dangers black gun owners face when interacting with police.

Roberson's death is the latest incident in recent years where a black gun owner was fatally shot by police. " Roberson was both an armed security guard and a good guy with a gun.
