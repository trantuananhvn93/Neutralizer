Eleven people have been killed, officials say, in a gun attack on a synagogue in the US city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Squirrel Hill has one of the largest Jewish populations in Pennsylvania and this would have been the synagogue's busiest day of the week. He said that no children were among the casualties. What has been President Trump's reaction? Mr Trump has also said that the incident had" little to do" with US gun laws. " Now I'm just sad. This should not be happening. It should not be happening in a synagogue. It should not be happening in our neighbourhood here in Squirrel Hill," he said.
