A police officer fatally shot an armed security guard who witnesses say was trying to detain a man following a shooting at a suburban Chicago bar, authorities said. " Everybody is screaming out,' He's a security guard,'" Harris said. Roberson was licensed to carry a firearm, Ansari said. Investigators said the initial gunfire was reported around 4 am. The person was later identified as Roberson. Roberson, who was black, was the only person killed in the shooting. Roberson was working to" enough money together for a deposit on a new apartment", said Hunter, the great uncle of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager fatally shot in 2014 by a white Chicago police officer. Illinois state police are handling the investigation into Roberson's shooting.
