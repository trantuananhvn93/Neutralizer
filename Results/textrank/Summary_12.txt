Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee and Democratic nominee for Florida governor, has withdrawn his Election Day concession to opponent and hero to racists, Ron DeSantis. Florida is doing a recount of votes. This recount applies to races across the state. The recount will also apply to the Senate race between Republican Governor Rick Scott and Democratic Senator, Bill Nelson. A very slim margin also looms over the race between Nikki Fried, the Democratic agriculture commissioner, and Republican Matt Caldwell. Georgia and Arizona are also fighting to get every vote counted, with particular attention on Stacey Abrams, who has yet to concede to former Secretary of State Brian Kemp in Georgia's battle for governor. Whether the votes come in Republican, Democrat, or other, they all matter.
