Florida has ordered a machine recount of votes for state governor and senator following last week's closely fought mid-term elections, officials say. Mr DeSantis, however, insisted that the results were" clear and unambiguous, just as they were on election night". Mr Scott, who claimed victory on Tuesday, is suing officials over an election recount, while Mr Nelson is suing over uncounted ballots- and there have also been a number of protests outside the elections office. In one of his three lawsuits against election overseers, Mr Scott has asked a judge to impound voting machines and ballots when they are not in use. But election officials stated that the box contained only supplies. Florida has a history with close elections.
