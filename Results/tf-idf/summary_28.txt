The suspected gunman behind Saturday's shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue, which left 11 people dead and six more injured, has been formally charged, prosecutors said.
Robert Bowers, 46, was charged late Saturday with 29 federal counts of crimes of violence and firearms offenses after authorities say he carried out an anti-Semitic attack on Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath.
Bowers is facing 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death; 11 of use of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence; four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer; and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.
Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said police were dispatched to Tree of Life Synagogue at 9:55 am after receiving calls describing an active-shooter situation in the city's predominantly Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood.
He confirmed that all four law enforcement officials are in stable condition.The FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh office, Bob Jones, said that it was the most "horrific crime scene" he's witnessed in his 22-year career with the bureau.
