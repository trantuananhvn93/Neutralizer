Florida began the first full, statewide vote recount in its history on Saturday after authorities found that tallies submitted by its 67 counties left the contests for Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner too close to call.
Recounts were also ordered in a State Senate race and two contests for the State House, a measure of the slender margins in the nation's largest swing state that have left two of the most closely watched races in the country still undecided, four days after the midterm elections.
The sight of grim-faced candidates, shouting protesters outside the Broward County elections office and lawyers flown in from Washington evoked memories of Florida's hotly contested recount over the 2000 presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore and capped off one of the most bitterly divisive midterm election seasons in years.
The odds that Mr Gillum, who trails by 0.41 percentage points, and even Mr Nelson, who is behind by about 0.15 percentage points, will find themselves on top after a recount seem low, according to veterans of Florida's presidential recount in 2000.
Marc Elias, Mr Nelson's lawyer, has maintained that a machine error might still account for fewer votes for Mr Nelson - an issue that would only be caught in a manual recount.
