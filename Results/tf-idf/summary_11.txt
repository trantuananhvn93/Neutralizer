The two marquee races in Florida remain so tight they are officially headed toward a recount, the state secretary of state, Ken Detzner-an appointee of current Florida governor and Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott-announced Saturday.
The recounts seemed inevitable as the races tightened in the aftermath of Tuesday's vote and became a certainty after the noon deadline Saturday for county election supervisors to submit their results passed with both races within the 0.5 percent margin that legally mandates a recount.
In the Senate race, because it's closer than 0.25 percent, an additional hand recount is required by law of votes that were not initially counted by the voting machines for whatever reason.
The Florida Department of State has sent monitors to Broward County, which had tallied more than 700,000 votes as of Thursday afternoon, stemming from a lawsuit over the county's mishandling of 2016 congressional race ballots.
Further complicating matters in the Senate race is a potential ballot design flaw that may have caused tens of thousands of voters to skip over the Senate contest in Broward County, which was buried underneath the ballot instructions.
