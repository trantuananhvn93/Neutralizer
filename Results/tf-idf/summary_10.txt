Rick Scott's campaign filed a handful of lawsuits seeking to give law enforcement custody of election equipment and prevent certain ballots from being included in official results.
Scott accused Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections in Broward County, of violating state law by refusing to provide information to his campaign about the number of outstanding ballots.
In a separate suit against Snipes, Scott's campaign asked a judge to block Broward County from counting any of the ballots it didn't include in the unofficial results it submitted to the Florida Department of State by noon Saturday, a deadline set by state law.
Nelson's campaign also has a lawsuit seeking to force the state to count ballots thrown out because the signature on them didn't match the one on file with the state's voter registration.
In a televised statement in front of the governor's mansion Thursday evening, Scott suggested there was "rampant fraud" in Broward and Palm Beach counties and asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate.
