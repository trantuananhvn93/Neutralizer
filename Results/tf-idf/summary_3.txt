A police officer fatally shot an armed security guard who witnesses say was trying to detain a man following a shooting at a suburban Chicago bar, authorities said.
Four other people were shot and wounded during the incident, including a man who police believe fired a gun before police arrived, the Cook county sheriff's spokeswoman, Sophia Ansari, said.
When police arrived at the scene, Roberson was holding "somebody on the ground with his knee in his back, with his gun in his back," witness Adam Harris told WGN-TV.
The Rev Marvin Hunter said Roberson was an "upstanding young man" and a promising keyboard player who played at his and several other area churches.
Roberson was working to "enough money together for a deposit on a new apartment", said Hunter, the great uncle of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager fatally shot in 2014 by a white Chicago police officer.
