The man accused of killing 11 Jews in an anti-Semitic attack at a Pittsburgh synagogue was charged in a 44-count indictment that includes federal hate crimes.
Suspect Robert Bowers, 46, "made statements indicating his desire to 'kill Jews'" in the shooting attack on Saturday, the Department of Justice said in its indictment Wednesday.
Grieving family, friends and neighbors of the 11 people gunned down at the Tree of Life synagogue meanwhile continued Wednesday with a series of funerals.
Melvin Wax, a retired accountant, was a fixture of the Tree of Life congregation, friend Myron Snider told The Associated Press.
President Donald Trump and the first lady, joined by the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump, visited the synagogue Tuesday afternoon.
