1	"A security guard at an Illinois bar was shot and killed early Sunday by a police officer who arrived at the scene following reports of a shooting. Jemel Roberson, 26, was shot by a Midlothian police officer who arrived at Manny's Blue Room Lounge in Robbins, Illinois, around 4 a.m. on Sunday. According to a statement by Midlothian Police Department Chief Daniel Delaney, officers who arrived at the scene"" learned there were several gunshot victims inside the bar."" "" Officers encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an Officer involved shooting,"" the statement, which does not identify the police officer, said. She said she did not hear police tell Roberson to put his gun down. The Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force is investigating the police-involved shooting."
2	"Shortly after Roberson subdued the suspect at gunpoint, police arrived- and fatally shot the armed security guard as he pinned the suspect to the ground. When officers from the Robbins and Midlothian police departments arrived, one officer opened fire, killing Roberson. The shooting also calls attention to the dangers black gun owners face when interacting with police. But the statement from the state police argues that the responding officer had no way to know Roberson was security and that he only fired after Roberson did not respond to commands. Roberson's death is the latest incident in recent years where a black gun owner was fatally shot by police. "" Roberson was both an armed security guard and a good guy with a gun."
3	"A police officer fatally shot an armed security guard who witnesses say was trying to detain a man following a shooting at a suburban Chicago bar, authorities said. Investigators said 26-year-old Jemel Roberson was pronounced dead shortly after being taken to a hospital following the shooting early on Sunday at Manny's Blue Room in Robbins, just south of Chicago. "" Everybody is screaming out,' He's a security guard,'"" Harris said. Roberson was licensed to carry a firearm, Ansari said. Investigators said the initial gunfire was reported around 4 am. The person was later identified as Roberson. Roberson, who was black, was the only person killed in the shooting. Illinois state police are handling the investigation into Roberson's shooting."
4	"When police arrived after reports of a shooting over the weekend at a bar outside Chicago, witnesses say Jemel Roberson, a 26-year-old security guard who worked there, had already subdued the alleged assailant in the parking lot, pinning him to the ground. But the"" subject"" was Roberson, not the suspect in the bar shooting. She said it was"" absolutely clear"" that he was a security guard. Delaney said that the Cook County Sheriff's Office and the Robbins Police Department were investigating the shooting. Roberson was the father of a 9-month-old son. She added that Roberson had dreamed of being a police officer."" Roberson's family filed a lawsuit on Monday against the Midlothian police department and the officer who shot him, seeking damages of $ 1 million."
5	"An armed security guard at a bar in suburban Chicago was killed by police as he detained a suspected gunman, according to officials and witnesses. Moments after police came on the scene, an officer opened fire on Roberson, who was black, killing him. Friends say Roberson was a musician who had dreams of joining the police."" "" Just waiting on the police to get there. Images on social media show a chaotic scene outside the bar as witnesses shouted at police."" Illinois State Police's Public Integrity Taskforce have been asked to investigate the shooting, Ms Ansari told the BBC. How in the world does the security guard get shot by police?"" According to FBI data, a disproportionately high proportion of police shootings in the US involve black people."
6	"After the authorities responded, a police officer shot the guard, Jemel Roberson, 26, who had a gun, Ms. Ansari said. Mr. Roberson died at the hospital. Witnesses said that people in the crowd had yelled to arriving police officers that Mr. Roberson, who was wearing gear that read"" Security,"" was a guard. Ms. Ansari confirmed that Mr. Roberson worked for the bar. An officer with the Midlothian Police Department shot Mr. Roberson, Ms. Ansari said. On Monday, Mr. Roberson's mother, Beatrice Roberson, filed a federal lawsuit against the unnamed police officer and the village of Midlothian. The shooting of Mr. Roberson is being investigated by the Illinois State Police, who did not return a call for comment."
7	"A police officer mistakenly shot and killed a security guard at a bar in Chicago's south suburbs early Sunday morning, Chicago's Fox 32 reported. Armed security guards returned fire, the report said. One the guards-- Jemel Roberson, 26-- apprehended the suspect outside, witnesses said.

10	The race to count Florida's votes got even messier on Sunday as Gov. Rick Scott's campaign filed a handful of lawsuits seeking to give law enforcement custody of election equipment and prevent certain ballots from being included in official results. Scott accused Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections in Broward County, of violating state law by refusing to provide information to his campaign about the number of outstanding ballots. He also alleged Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County, had run afoul of state law by duplicating and damaging certain ballots.
11	The two marquee races in Florida remain so tight they are officially headed toward a recount, the state secretary of state, Ken Detzner- an appointee of current Florida governor and Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott-announced Saturday. In the Senate race, because it's closer than 0.25 percent, an additional hand recount is required by law of votes that were not initially counted by the voting machines for whatever reason. The Florida Department of State has sent monitors to Broward County, which had tallied more than 700,000 votes as of Thursday afternoon, stemming from a lawsuit over the county's mishandling of 2016 congressional race ballots. Roughly 10,000 fewer people voted in Broward County in the Senate race than for the commissioner of agriculture or the chief financial officer race, which is unusual.
12	Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee and Democratic nominee for Florida governor, has withdrawn his Election Day concession to opponent and hero to racists, Ron DeSantis. Florida is doing a recount of votes. This recount applies to races across the state. The recount will also apply to the Senate race between Republican Governor Rick Scott and Democratic Senator, Bill Nelson. A very slim margin also looms over the race between Nikki Fried, the Democratic agriculture commissioner, and Republican Matt Caldwell. This is big news, and not just for Florida constituents. Whether the votes come in Republican, Democrat, or other, they all matter.
13	""" Florida has never had a full statewide recount. "" We believe when every legal ballot is counted, we'll win this election."" A manual recount does not mean every ballot is counted by hand. "" There is a capacity issue when so many ballots come in on Election Day."" Mr. Scott claimed fraud in Broward County even though the state was monitoring Dr. Snipes's office during the election. Ultimately, the ballots are what they are,"" he said. "" The votes are what they are."""
14	"Florida has ordered a machine recount of votes for state governor and senator following last week's closely fought mid-term elections, officials say. Mr DeSantis, however, insisted that the results were"" clear and unambiguous, just as they were on election night"". Mr Scott, who claimed victory on Tuesday, is suing officials over an election recount, while Mr Nelson is suing over uncounted ballots- and there have also been a number of protests outside the elections office. But election officials stated that the box contained only supplies. The president said he would send his lawyers to Florida"" to expose the fraud"", calling the Nelson campaign's recount lawyer Marc Elias an election stealer. Florida has a history with close elections."
15	""" Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida!"" In the Senate race, the unofficial count had Republican Scott leading incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson by about 12,600 votes among roughly 8.2 million votes cast in the Nov. 6 election. The Florida governor on Sunday sued to have voting machines, tallying devices and ballots seized in Broward and Palm Beach counties. State elections officials said they had observers in Broward County and they had n't found evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Scott declared victory on election night, but slow vote-counting in Democrat-leaning Broward and Palm Beach counties narrowed the race to within the margin that dictates a recount. The official results of a manual recount would be due by Nov. 18."
16	"Florida Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott insisted Monday he"" won the election"" while accusing incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of trying to"" steal"" the race from him, amid chaotic recounts in the sunshine state's Senate and gubernatorial races. He's just here to steal the election."" President Trump on Monday referred to Florida's election as being"" massively infected."" An honest vote count is no longer possible- ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!"" But approximately 200,000 votes remain uncounted across the state, and Arizona election officials said they would not be finished tallying votes until Thursday. More than 2.3 million votes were cast in the historic election."
17	Florida authorities on Saturday ordered a statewide recount in the contentious races for US Senate and governor, amid tit-for-tat accusations of fraud from the candidates- plunging the state once again into election uncertainty. State law triggers a machine recount if the difference in a race is within 0.5 percent. Florida's secretary of state Ken Detzner issued the official order for the recounts after the deadline. The recount is reminiscent of the dramatic recounts that occurred in parts of Florida after the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Those recounts were halted by the US Supreme Court, and Bush defeated Gore by 537 votes in Florida to win the presidency. But Florida is not alone.
18	"Florida election officials ordered statewide ballot recounts Saturday as ferocious battles over vote tallies left Senate and governor's races there in doubt. Unofficial vote totals submitted today at noon gave Republican Ron DeSantis a 0.4 percent edge over Democrat Andrew Gillum in the governor's race, triggering an automatic machine recount under state law. If the machine recount yields a margin of victory less than 0.25 percent, state law requires Florida to conduct a hand recount that could take weeks. Bill Nelson's lawyer Marc Elias has previously stated that margins smaller than ours are' insurmountable,'"" Scott's campaign said. As news of the recount broke, Trump weighed in on Twitter. "" Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!"" he stated."
19	"He reportedly made anti-Semitic statements during the shooting, and just beforehand posted on Gab, a right-wing social network, about hias, a Jewish nonprofit that supports refugees. Earlier, he had suggested that he supported far-right nationalism but believed that President Trump was captive to a Jewish conspiracy."" American history has been marked by acts of anti-Semitic violence, including the shootings at Jewish community centers in Kansas City, in 2014, and Los Angeles, in 1999. It has been marked, too, by mass murders in houses of worship-in recent years, the massacre of twenty-six people at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, last November, and the murder of nine African-American worshippers at Emanuel A.M.E. Church, in Charleston, South Carolina, by the white supremacist Dylann Roof."
20	"itic slurs opened fire inside a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday morning, killing at least 11 congregants and wounding four police officers and two others, the authorities said. Mr. Bowers had already shot and killed 11 people and was on his way out of the synagogue, Mr. Jones said, when he encountered police officers and shot at them. He went back into the synagogue to hide from SWAT officers who were moving in, Mr. Jones said. He was in the synagogue for about 20 minutes, law enforcement officials said. Residents near the synagogue were told to stay inside their homes. Pittsburgh's public safety director described the crime scene as"" horrific."""
21	"Eleven people have been killed, officials say, in a gun attack on a synagogue in the US city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Squirrel Hill has one of the largest Jewish populations in Pennsylvania and this would have been the synagogue's busiest day of the week. He said that no children were among the casualties. Mr Bowers is receiving treatment for what has been described as multiple gunshot wounds. What has been President Trump's reaction? Mr Trump has also said that the incident had"" little to do"" with US gun laws. "" Now I'm just sad. This should not be happening. It should not be happening in a synagogue. It should not be happening in our neighbourhood here in Squirrel Hill,"" he said."
22	"The man accused of killing 11 Jews in an anti-Semitic attack at a Pittsburgh synagogue was charged in a 44-count indictment that includes federal hate crimes. Friends and family gathered at separate funerals to remember Joyce Fienberg, 75, Irving Younger, 69, and Melvin Wax, 88, who were among the 11 worshippers gunned down. Fienberg, a former research specialist, is survived by her two sons and grandchildren. Melvin Wax, a retired accountant, was a fixture of the Tree of Life congregation, friend Myron Snider told The Associated Press. Until he saw what the stranger was doing-- because that's the kind of thought that he would have,"" said Schachter, the former congregation president."
23	""" It is a very horrific crime scene,"" said a visibly moved Wendell Hissrich, the Pittsburgh public safety director. Daniel Leger was scheduled to lead a service Saturday morning, he said. The organization says it is guided by Jewish values and history. "" Our hearts break for the families of those killed and injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and for the entire Jewish community of Pittsburgh,"" Greenblatt said. "" We stand together with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh. The synagogue is located in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. But on Sabbath it's an open door,"" he said."
24	"Eight people are reportedly dead and more wounded after a gunman opened fire at a synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday morning. Police spokesman Chris Togneri said that a suspect is in custody after being taken to the hospital, adding that there are"" multiple casualties inside the synagogue."" Togneri said that three officers were shot and police were clearing the building. Multiple law enforcement sources told local CBS affiliate KDKA and CNN that the gunman had been identified as Robert Bowers, 46. Police had rushed to the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue, where attendees had gathered for a Saturday service. At a press conference Saturday afternoon, Togneri would not confirm the status of the package, but noted that no other potential packages or explosives were being investigated currently by police."
25	"Eleven people were killed Saturday morning during a mass-shooting at The Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that ended in the arrest of a single suspect, Robert Bowers, and the recovery of multiple weapons. The shooter, a 46-year-old Pittsburgh resident, likewise sustained injuries. The rampage unfolded during morning services, turning the Jewish house of worship into a gruesome crime scene the city's public safety director, Wendell Hissrich, compared to a"" plane crash."" The Tree of Life Synagogue reported an active shooting situation at 9:54 a.m. Saturday morning, and law enforcement officers were dispatched within seconds, Mr. Hissrich said at a press conference. The Tree of Life Synagogue hosts weekly services every Saturday morning, according to its website."

The conservative Tree of Life Synagogue had been packed with three separate congregations attending Saturday morning services when the bloodbath began at around 10 a.m. Pennsylvania's Attorney General Josh Shapiro said the shooting happened during the portion of the ceremony when the child is given a Hebrew name. The suspect-identified by CBS affiliate KDKA as 46-year-old Robert Bowers, a bearded, heavyset resident of Pittsburgh- was armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle and two handguns, according to multiple reports. None of the injured officers were likely to die, according to officials. "" It's a very horrific crime scene."
