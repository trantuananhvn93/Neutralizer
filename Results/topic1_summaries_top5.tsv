1	1	Accidental shooting	A Security Guard Who Stopped A Gunman At A Bar Was Shot And Killed By Responding Police	BuzzFeed News	https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maryanngeorgantopoulos/security-guard-illinois-bar-police-shot-killed-gun	A security guard at an Illinois bar was shot and killed early Sunday by a police officer who arrived at the scene following reports of a shooting. Jemel Roberson, 26, was shot by a Midlothian police officer who arrived at Manny's Blue Room Lounge in Robbins, Illinois, around 4 am on Sunday. "Officers encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an Officer involved shooting," the statement, which does not identify the police officer, said. "I guess when the police got there, they probably thought he was one of the bad guys, cause he had his gun on the guy and they shot him," Harris told Fox32. Roberson played music at the Purposed Church in Chicago for the past several years, according to Pastor LeAundre Hill, who tweeted that Roberson "had just played for my grandma's funeral Friday and now he's gone."
2	1	Accidental Shooting	A black security guard caught a shooting suspect - only to be shot by police minutes later	Vox	https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/11/12/18088874/jemel-roberson-police-shooting-security-guard-illinois	Shortly after Roberson subdued the suspect at gunpoint, police arrived - and fatally shot the armed security guard as he pinned the suspect to the ground. In preliminary findings released on Tuesday, Illinois State Police (which is tasked with investigating the shooting) argued that the officer gave Roberson "multiple verbal commands" to drop his weapon before opening fire. Gregory Kulis, a lawyer representing Roberson's mother in a civil rights lawsuit filed after the shooting, said that Roberson had a hat with the words "SECURITY" on it. But the statement from the state police argues that the responding officer had no way to know Roberson was security and that he only fired after Roberson did not respond to commands. Patricia Hill, another pastor at Purposed Church, said that Roberson wanted to become a police officer, calling it a tragedy that he was killed in a police shooting.

Investigators said 26-year-old Jemel Roberson was pronounced dead shortly after being taken to a hospital following the shooting early on Sunday at Manny's Blue Room in Robbins, just south of Chicago. Four other people were shot and wounded during the incident, including a man who police believe fired a gun before police arrived, the Cook county sheriff's spokeswoman, Sophia Ansari, said. When police arrived at the scene, Roberson was holding "somebody on the ground with his knee in his back, with his gun in his back," witness Adam Harris told WGN-TV. Roberson was working to "enough money together for a deposit on a new apartment", said Hunter, the great uncle of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager fatally shot in 2014 by a white Chicago police officer.

Adam Harris, who was at Manny's Blue Bar in Robbins at the time of the incident on Sunday, told WGN-TV that Roberson was holding "somebody on the ground with his knee in his back, with his gun in his back" when officers from neighboring Midlothian got there early Sunday. On Tuesday, Illinois State Police issued a statement saying that "a Midlothian Police Officer encountered a subject in plain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a Security Guard, armed with a gun in the west parking lot." Another witness, Jakia Woods, told member station WBEZ's Miles Bryan that Roberson was wearing an orange vest and the hat marked "security." Roberson's family filed a lawsuit on Monday against the Midlothian police department and the officer who shot him, seeking damages of $1 million.

10	2	Florida midterm vote recount	One Day In, Florida's Senate Recount Gets Messier	The Huffington Post	https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-recount-rick-scott-bill-nelson_us_5be8b7f6e4b0769d24ceb6c9?guccounter=1	Rick Scott's campaign filed a handful of lawsuits seeking to give law enforcement custody of election equipment and prevent certain ballots from being included in official results. Scott accused Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections in Broward County, of violating state law by refusing to provide information to his campaign about the number of outstanding ballots. In a separate suit against Snipes, Scott's campaign asked a judge to block Broward County from counting any of the ballots it didn't include in the unofficial results it submitted to the Florida Department of State by noon Saturday, a deadline set by state law. Nelson's campaign also has a lawsuit seeking to force the state to count ballots thrown out because the signature on them didn't match the one on file with the state's voter registration. In a televised statement in front of the governor's mansion Thursday evening, Scott suggested there was "rampant fraud" in Broward and Palm Beach counties and asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate.
11	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Florida Officially Orders Statewide Recount in Senate and Governor's Races	Slate	https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/11/florida-election-recount-senate-governor-race-nelson-scott-desantis-gillum.html	The two marquee races in Florida remain so tight they are officially headed toward a recount, the state secretary of state, Ken Detzner-an appointee of current Florida governor and Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott-announced Saturday. The recounts seemed inevitable as the races tightened in the aftermath of Tuesday's vote and became a certainty after the noon deadline Saturday for county election supervisors to submit their results passed with both races within the 0.5 percent margin that legally mandates a recount. In the Senate race, because it's closer than 0.25 percent, an additional hand recount is required by law of votes that were not initially counted by the voting machines for whatever reason. The Florida Department of State has sent monitors to Broward County, which had tallied more than 700,000 votes as of Thursday afternoon, stemming from a lawsuit over the county's mishandling of 2016 congressional race ballots. Further complicating matters in the Senate race is a potential ballot design flaw that may have caused tens of thousands of voters to skip over the Senate contest in Broward County, which was buried underneath the ballot instructions.
12	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Andrew Gillum withdraws his concession as the Florida recount is officially on for three key races	Daily Kos	https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/11/10/1811855/-Andrew-Gillum-withdraws-his-concession-as-the-Florida-recount-is-officially-on-for-three-key-races	Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee and Democratic nominee for Florida governor, has withdrawn his Election Day concession to opponent and hero to racists, Ron DeSantis. Earlier today, Ken Detzner, Florida's Secretary of State, announced that the state was doing a recount via machine. This part of the process has to be wrapped up by Thursday, at 3 pm Additionally, if races come within a .25 percent margin, those votes trigger a recount by hand. Georgia and Arizona are also fighting to get every vote counted, with particular attention on Stacey Abrams, who has yet to concede to former Secretary of State Brian Kemp in Georgia's battle for governor. It's also a big deal on a symbolic level, as President Donald Trump seems to think not every vote matters, as shown by his snark on Twitter: "You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia - but the Election was on Tuesday?
13	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Florida Begins Vote Recounts in Senate and Governor's Races	The New York Times	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/us/florida-senate-governor-votes-recount.html	Florida began the first full, statewide vote recount in its history on Saturday after authorities found that tallies submitted by its 67 counties left the contests for Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner too close to call. Recounts were also ordered in a State Senate race and two contests for the State House, a measure of the slender margins in the nation's largest swing state that have left two of the most closely watched races in the country still undecided, four days after the midterm elections. The sight of grim-faced candidates, shouting protesters outside the Broward County elections office and lawyers flown in from Washington evoked memories of Florida's hotly contested recount over the 2000 presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore and capped off one of the most bitterly divisive midterm election seasons in years. Mr Scott, who has filed lawsuits against elections officials in Broward and Palm Beach Counties over the handling of ballots, made it clear he was not expecting to relinquish the seat he claimed on Tuesday night and suggested the latest results filed on Saturday had reconfirmed it. The odds that Mr Gillum, who trails by 0.41 percentage points, and even Mr Nelson, who is behind by about 0.15 percentage points, will find themselves on top after a recount seem low, according to veterans of Florida's presidential recount in 2000.
14	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Mid-term elections 2018: Recounts descend into rancour	BBC News	https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46166980	Florida has ordered a machine recount of votes for state governor and senator following last week's closely fought mid-term elections, officials say. In the race for Florida's Senate seat, unofficial results revealed a gap of just 0.15% between the votes for incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson and Mr Scott. Mr Scott, who claimed victory on Tuesday, is suing officials over an election recount, while Mr Nelson is suing over uncounted ballots - and there have also been a number of protests outside the elections office. Mr Trump told reporters on Friday, before leaving for Paris to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, that he believed that Mr Scott had clearly won the election. Mr Gore's fate was finally sealed by a US Supreme Court ruling that said in essence that time had run out for recounts in the crucial state, granting Mr Bush the presidency.
15	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Florida Senate and Governor Races Go to Recount	Bloomberg	https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-10/florida-orders-statewide-recount-on-senate-governor-races	Florida's Senate and governor's races have gone to a recount that will decide two key offices in the largest US swing state, setting off outcries from Republicans led by President Donald Trump and Rick Scott, the state's governor now vying to be a US Senator. In the Senate race, the unofficial count had Republican Scott leading incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson by about 12,600 votes among roughly 8.2 million votes cast in the Nov 6 election. Trump, Scott and other Republicans have attempted to sow doubt about the process and raise suspicions about electoral officials, especially Broward County's election supervisor Brenda Snipes, who oversaw the vote in the state's second-most populous county, which includes Fort Lauderdale and Coral Springs. Pressed on ABC's "This Week" on Sunday to offer one piece of evidence that efforts are underway to "steal" the Florida election, as Trump tweeted Saturday, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway cited "boxes of votes just appearing out of nowhere" and past criticism of Snipes. The race for Florida's agriculture commissioner will go to a recount as well, with Democrat Nikki Fried now edging Republican Matt Caldwell by about 5,300 votes.
16	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Rick Scott insists he 'won the election,' as recount chaos keeps Florida races in suspense	Fox News	https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rick-scott-insists-he-won-the-election-as-election-chaos-keeps-florida-georgia-and-arizona-races-in-suspense	Florida Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott insisted Monday he "won the election" while accusing incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of trying to "steal" the race from him, amid chaotic recounts in the sunshine state's Senate and gubernatorial races. Over the weekend, Florida's secretary of state Ken Detzner announced there would be recounts in both the Senate race and the governor's race, noting that unofficial results in both races fell within the margin that by law triggers a recount. In the Florida governor's race, Republican candidate Ron DeSantis was announced the winner by the end of Election Day, with his Democratic opponent Andrew Gillum conceding on the night of the election. "The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. In Georgia's gubernatorial race, Republican Brian Kemp declared victory, though his Democratic opponent Stacey Abrams refused to concede and filed a federal lawsuit in an effort to force a runoff election.
17	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Florida Orders Recount in Senate, Governor Races	Breitbart	https://www.breitbart.com/news/florida-orders-recount-in-senate-governor-races/	Florida authorities on Saturday ordered a statewide recount in the contentious races for US Senate and governor, amid tit-for-tat accusations of fraud from the candidates - plunging the state once again into election uncertainty. After the cut-off, the Senate race between outgoing Republican governor Rick Scott and incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson was super close: Scott's lead stood at just 12,562 votes out of nearly 8.2 million cast, a margin of just 0.15 percent. In the governor's race, the latest unofficial results on the Florida division of elections website show Republican Ron DeSantis, who was backed by Donald Trump, leading Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum by just 33,684 votes out of more than 8.2 million cast, or a margin of 0.41 percent. On Saturday, he urged Florida's sheriffs to "watch for any violations during the recount process as outlined in Florida law." The recount is reminiscent of the dramatic recounts that occurred in parts of Florida after the 2000 presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore.
18	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Florida orders recount for governor and Senate races	New York Post	https://nypost.com/2018/11/10/florida-orders-recount-for-governor-and-senate-races/	Florida election officials ordered statewide ballot recounts Saturday as ferocious battles over vote tallies left Senate and governor's races there in doubt. Unofficial vote totals submitted today at noon gave Republican Ron DeSantis a 0.4 percent edge over Democrat Andrew Gillum in the governor's race, triggering an automatic machine recount under state law. Rick Scott's advantage over incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson in the fight for a seat in the US Senate was just 0.15 percent - 12,562 votes out of nearly 8.2 million cast. If the machine recount yields a margin of victory less than 0.25 percent, state law requires Florida to conduct a hand recount that could take weeks. "Bill Nelson's lawyer Marc Elias has previously stated that margins smaller than ours are 'insurmountable,'" Scott's campaign said.
19	3	Synagogue shooting	The Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting and the Escalating Crisis of Hate-Fuelled Violence in the Trump Era	The New Yorker	https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/the-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-and-the-escalating-crisis-of-hate-fuelled-violence-in-the-trump-era	Robert Bowers, who opened fire at the Tree of Life Synagogue, in Pittsburgh, this morning, killing at least eleven people, was not evasive about his intent. It has been marked, too, by mass murders in houses of worship-in recent years, the massacre of twenty-six people at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, last November, and the murder of nine African-American worshippers at Emanuel AME Church, in Charleston, South Carolina, by the white supremacist Dylann Roof. On Wednesday afternoon, a man named Gregory Bush allegedly shot and killed two African-American customers at a Kroger's supermarket in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, reportedly saying afterward, "Whites don't kill whites." But the massacres in Pittsburgh and Jeffersontown-and the pipe bombs sent to a dozen Democratic leaders this week, allegedly by the Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc-share some obvious common causes. They are the toxic politics of the President, and the racist, nationalist fervor that has been inflamed by his rise, and the success and the militancy of the gun lobby, which for decades has refused to acknowledge the obvious: that one way to have fewer killings is to make it harder for Americans to possess guns.

Pittsburgh residents embraced near Tree of Life Congregation after the shooting.Calling it the "most horrific crime scene" he had seen in 22 years with the FBI, Robert Jones, special agent in charge in Pittsburgh, said the synagogue was in the midst of a "peaceful service" when congregants were gunned down and "brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith." Police dispatchers received the first emergency calls at 9:54 am, Mr Jones of the FBI said, and police officers, including a SWAT team, were dispatched a minute later. Mr Bowers had already shot and killed 11 people and was on his way out of the synagogue, Mr Jones said, when he encountered police officers and shot at them. Ben Opie, 55, who can see the synagogue from his backyard, said his wife was about to leave their house to do some volunteer work when SWAT officers approached their home and said there was a gunman in the synagogue.

Pittsburgh FBI's special agent in charge of the investigation, Bob Jones, told a press conference that Mr Bowers did not appear to be known to authorities prior to events on Saturday. Former US President Barack Obama voiced a different position on the ongoing gun law debate, tweeting: "We have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun.

Friends and family gathered at separate funerals to remember Joyce Fienberg, 75, Irving Younger, 69, and Melvin Wax, 88, who were among the 11 worshippers gunned down. President Donald Trump and the first lady, joined by the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump, visited the synagogue Tuesday afternoon.
