A police officer fatally shot an armed security guard who was wearing a hat with "security" emblazoned across the front and holding a man down following a shooting inside the suburban Chicago bar where the guard worked, an attorney for the guard's family said Monday after filing a federal lawsuit.
Four others were shot and wounded, including a man who police believe fired a gun before police arrived, Cook County sheriff's spokeswoman Sophia Ansari said.
Attorney Gregory Kulis filed a civil rights lawsuit seeking more than $1 million on behalf of Roberson's mother, Beatrice Roberson.
Kulis also echoed witness reports that Roberson was holding down another man outside the bar when the officer arrived and shot him.
Roberson was trying to "get enough money together for a deposit on a new apartment," said Hunter, the great uncle of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager fatally shot by a white Chicago police officer in a high-profile 2014 case.
