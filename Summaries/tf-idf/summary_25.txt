Eleven people were killed Saturday morning during a mass-shooting at The Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that ended in the arrest of a single suspect, Robert Bowers, and the recovery of multiple weapons.
"This is the most horrific crime scene I've seen in 22 years," echoed Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge at the bureau's Pittsburgh office, adding that 11 people were "brutally murdered by a gunman simply targeting them because of their faith."
The Tree of Life Synagogue reported an active shooting situation at 9:54 am Saturday morning, and law enforcement officers were dispatched within seconds, Mr Hissrich said at a press conference.
Law enforcement officials engaged the suspect upon arriving, and two police officers and two SWAT officers were among the six victims who suffered non-fatal injuries, Mr Hissrich added.
Located in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of eastern Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's second largest city, The Tree of Life Synagogue hosts weekly services every Saturday morning, according to its website.
