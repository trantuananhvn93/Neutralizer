A black security guard at a bar in the Chicago suburbs was killed by the police as he apparently tried to detain a man he believed to be involved in a shooting, the authorities said Monday.
After the authorities responded, a police officer shot the guard, Jemel Roberson, 26, who had a gun, Ms. Ansari said.
Witnesses said that people in the crowd had yelled to arriving police officers that Mr Roberson, who was wearing gear that read "Security," was a guard.
An officer with the Midlothian Police Department shot Mr Roberson, Ms. Ansari said.
On Monday, Mr Roberson's mother, Beatrice Roberson, filed a federal lawsuit against the unnamed police officer and the village of Midlothian.
