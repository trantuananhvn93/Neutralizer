Florida authorities on Saturday ordered a statewide recount in the contentious races for US Senate and governor, amid tit-for-tat accusations of fraud from the candidates - plunging the state once again into election uncertainty.
After the cut-off, the Senate race between outgoing Republican governor Rick Scott and incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson was super close: Scott's lead stood at just 12,562 votes out of nearly 8.2 million cast, a margin of just 0.15 percent.
In the governor's race, the latest unofficial results on the Florida division of elections website show Republican Ron DeSantis, who was backed by Donald Trump, leading Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum by just 33,684 votes out of more than 8.2 million cast, or a margin of 0.41 percent.
On Saturday, he urged Florida's sheriffs to "watch for any violations during the recount process as outlined in Florida law."
The recount is reminiscent of the dramatic recounts that occurred in parts of Florida after the 2000 presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore.
