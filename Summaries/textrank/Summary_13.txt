" Florida has never had a full statewide recount. And Florida was not the only state still trying to determine election outcomes. " We believe when every legal ballot is counted, we'll win this election." Mr. Scott denounced the embattled Broward County elections supervisor, Brenda C. Snipes, who, the campaign said Friday night, still refused to confirm whether she had counted all the ballots. A manual recount does not mean every ballot is counted by hand. " There is a capacity issue when so many ballots come in on Election Day." Mr. Scott claimed fraud in Broward County even though the state was monitoring Dr. Snipes's office during the election. Ultimately, the ballots are what they are," he said. " The votes are what they are."
