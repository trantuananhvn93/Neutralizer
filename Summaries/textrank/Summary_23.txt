" It is a very horrific crime scene," said a visibly moved Wendell Hissrich, the Pittsburgh public safety director. Daniel Leger was scheduled to lead a service Saturday morning, he said. The organization says it is guided by Jewish values and history. " We stand together with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh. The synagogue is located in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. But he said security was a concern, and the synagogue had started working to improve it. But on Sabbath it's an open door," he said.
