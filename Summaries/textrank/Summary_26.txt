burst into a Pittsburgh synagogue during Sabbath services, shooting and killing at least 11 people and wounding a half-dozen more, including four police officers, before surrendering. Pennsylvania's Attorney General Josh Shapiro said the shooting happened during the portion of the ceremony when the child is given a Hebrew name. The suspect-identified by CBS affiliate KDKA as 46-year-old Robert Bowers, a bearded, heavyset resident of Pittsburgh- was armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle and two handguns, according to multiple reports. None of the injured officers were likely to die, according to officials. " It's a very horrific crime scene. The investigation will be led by the FBI in Philadelphia, and the shooting has been classified a federal hate crime, he said.
