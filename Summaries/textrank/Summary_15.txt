" Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida!" In the Senate race, the unofficial count had Republican Scott leading incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson by about 12,600 votes among roughly 8.2 million votes cast in the Nov. 6 election. The Florida governor on Sunday sued to have voting machines, tallying devices and ballots seized in Broward and Palm Beach counties. State elections officials said they had observers in Broward County and they had n't found evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Scott declared victory on election night, but slow vote-counting in Democrat-leaning Broward and Palm Beach counties narrowed the race to within the margin that dictates a recount. Florida elections have a history of minuscule margins and allegations of improprieties at polling stations and in vote-counting.
