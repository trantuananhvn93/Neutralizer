19	3	Synagogue shooting	The Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting and the Escalating Crisis of Hate-Fuelled Violence in the Trump Era	The New Yorker	https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/the-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-and-the-escalating-crisis-of-hate-fuelled-violence-in-the-trump-era	 Robert Bowers, who opened fire at the Tree of Life Synagogue, in Pittsburgh, this morning, killing at least eleven people, was not evasive about his intent. He reportedly made anti-Semitic statements during the shooting, and just beforehand posted on Gab, a right-wing social network, about hias, a Jewish nonprofit that supports refugees. Earlier, he had suggested that he supported far-right nationalism but believed that President Trump was captive to a Jewish conspiracy. It has been marked, too, by mass murders in houses of worship-in recent years, the massacre of twenty-six people at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, last November, and the murder of nine African-American worshippers at Emanuel AME Church, in Charleston, South Carolina, by the white supremacist Dylann Roof. The Tree of Life shooting, however, was the second attempted hate-fuelled massacre in a house of worship within seventy-two hours. On Wednesday afternoon, a man named Gregory Bush allegedly shot and killed two African-American customers at a Kroger's supermarket in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, reportedly saying afterward, "Whites don't kill whites." Ten to fifteen minutes before, he had tried the predominantly black First Baptist Church, where he spent several minutes rattling the locked doors. But the massacres in Pittsburgh and Jeffersontown-and the pipe bombs sent to a dozen Democratic leaders this week, allegedly by the Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc-share some obvious common causes.  Trump, asked about the Pittsburgh shooting, said, "If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better." 
20	3	Synagogue shooting	11 Killed in Synagogue Massacre Suspect Charged With 29 Counts	The New York Times	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting.html	 Armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle and at least three handguns, a man shouting anti-Semitic slurs opened fire inside a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday morning, killing at least 11 congregants and wounding four police officers and two others, the authorities said. The assailant, identified by law enforcement officials as Robert D Bowers, fired for several minutes and was leaving the synagogue when officers, dressed in tactical gear and armed with rifles, met him at the door. He also faces state charges, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation. Pittsburgh residents embraced near Tree of Life Congregation after the shooting.Calling it the "most horrific crime scene" he had seen in 22 years with the FBI, Robert Jones, special agent in charge in Pittsburgh, said the synagogue was in the midst of a "peaceful service" when congregants were gunned down and "brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith." Last November, a gunman killed 26 worshipers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., and in 2015, a white supremacist killed nine congregants in a church in Charleston, SC It came amid rising anxiety about illegal immigration and in a decade that has seen an uptick in hate crimes. Police dispatchers received the first emergency calls at 9:54 am, Mr Jones of the FBI said, and police officers, including a SWAT team, were dispatched a minute later.  He went back into the synagogue to hide from SWAT officers who were moving in, Mr Jones said. Ben Opie, 55, who can see the synagogue from his backyard, said his wife was about to leave their house to do some volunteer work when SWAT officers approached their home and said there was a gunman in the synagogue. Representative Mike Doyle, who represents Pennsylvania's 14th District, where the synagogue is, said that Mr Bowers had 21 guns registered to his name. 
21	3	Synagogue shooting	Pittsburgh shooting: Multiple casualties at Squirrel Hill synagogue	BBC	https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46002549?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c28q43x9qmzt/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting&link_location=live-reporting-story	 Eleven people have been killed, officials say, in a gun attack on a synagogue in the US city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Hundreds of people - from the neighbourhood and also all across Pittsburgh - later gathered for an interfaith vigil for the victims of the attack in Squirrel Hill. On Saturday morning, worshippers had gathered at the synagogue, in the Squirrel Hill neighbourhood, for a baby naming ceremony during the Sabbath. Squirrel Hill has one of the largest Jewish populations in Pennsylvania and this would have been the synagogue's busiest day of the week. Pittsburgh's Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich later confirmed Mr Bowers was in police custody and was being treated in hospital. Pittsburgh FBI's special agent in charge of the investigation, Bob Jones, told a press conference that Mr Bowers did not appear to be known to authorities prior to events on Saturday. Mr Trump has also said that the incident had "little to do" with US gun laws. The BBC's Dan Johnson in Washington says the shootings come at a tense time in the US, after a week in which mail bombs were sent to critics of Mr Trump, ahead of crucial mid-term elections next month. 
22	3	Synagogue shooting	Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect who allegedly stated aim to 'kill Jews' charged with federal hate crimes	ABC News	https://abcnews.go.com/US/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-victims-joyce-fienberg-melvin-wax/story?id=58872459	 The man accused of killing 11 Jews in an anti-Semitic attack at a Pittsburgh synagogue was charged in a 44-count indictment that includes federal hate crimes. Suspect Robert Bowers, 46, "made statements indicating his desire to 'kill Jews'" in the shooting attack on Saturday, the Department of Justice said in its indictment Wednesday. The charges include 11 counts of obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and 11 counts of use and discharge of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence. Grieving family, friends and neighbors of the 11 people gunned down at the Tree of Life synagogue meanwhile continued Wednesday with a series of funerals. Friends and family gathered at separate funerals to remember Joyce Fienberg, 75, Irving Younger, 69, and Melvin Wax, 88, who were among the 11 worshippers gunned down. Melvin Wax, a retired accountant, was a fixture of the Tree of Life congregation, friend Myron Snider told The Associated Press. Snider recalled that when he recently spent six weeks in the hospital for pneumonia, Wax "called my wife to get my phone number in the hospital so he could talk to me.  After visiting the synagogue, the president and first lady went to a hospital where they met police officers who were wounded in the attack and medical staff. 
23	3	Synagogue shooting	Pittsburgh Shooter Kills 11 in Worst Synagogue Attack in U.S.	Bloomberg	https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-27/pittsburgh-police-report-active-shooter-near-synagogue	 A gunman who's believed to have spewed anti-Semitic slurs and rhetoric on social media barged into a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday and opened fire, killing 11 people in one of the deadliest attacks on Jews in US history. The 20-minute attack at Tree of Life Congregation in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood left six others wounded, including four police officers who dashed to the scene, authorities said. The killings also immediately reignited the longstanding national debate about guns: President Donald Trump said the outcome might have been different if the synagogue "had some kind of protection" from an armed guard, while Pennsylvania's Democratic Gov. The Pennsylvania attorney general's office said it was told by victims that a brit milah - a ritual circumcision ceremony at which a baby boy also receives his Hebrew name - was also taking place, though law enforcement officials later said no children were among the dead or wounded. The survivors included Daniel Leger, 70, a nurse and hospital chaplain who was in critical condition after undergoing surgery, his brother, Paul Leger, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Bob Jones, head of the FBI's Pittsburgh office, said that worshippers "were brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith," though he cautioned the shooter's full motive was not yet known.  "Our hearts break for the families of those killed and injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and for the entire Jewish community of Pittsburgh," Greenblatt said. The synagogue is located in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. Eisenberg, the former synagogue president, said officials at Tree of Life had not gotten any threats that he knew of before the shooting.

Police spokesman Chris Togneri said that a suspect is in custody after being taken to the hospital, adding that there are "multiple casualties inside the synagogue." Multiple law enforcement sources told local CBS affiliate KDKA and CNN that the gunman had been identified as Robert Bowers, 46.

25	3	Synagogue shooting	Eleven dead, six wounded in Pittsburgh synagogue shooting; suspect in custody	The Washington Times	https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/27/shooting-mass-casualties-reported-tree-life-synago/	 Eleven people were killed Saturday morning during a mass-shooting at The Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that ended in the arrest of a single suspect, Robert Bowers, and the recovery of multiple weapons. "Anyone who does a thing like this to innocent people _ they should really pay the ultimate price," Mr Trump told reporters prior to heading to a farming event in Indiana. The rampage unfolded during morning services, turning the Jewish house of worship into a gruesome crime scene the city's public safety director, Wendell Hissrich, compared to a "plane crash." "This is the most horrific crime scene I've seen in 22 years," echoed Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge at the bureau's Pittsburgh office, adding that 11 people were "brutally murdered by a gunman simply targeting them because of their faith." The Tree of Life Synagogue reported an active shooting situation at 9:54 am Saturday morning, and law enforcement officers were dispatched within seconds, Mr Hissrich said at a press conference. Law enforcement officials engaged the suspect upon arriving, and two police officers and two SWAT officers were among the six victims who suffered non-fatal injuries, Mr Hissrich added. Police arrested the suspect around 20 minutes after the first shots were fired and subsequently recovered weapons including an assault rifle and three handguns, Mr Jones told reporters.  Located in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of eastern Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's second largest city, The Tree of Life Synagogue hosts weekly services every Saturday morning, according to its website. An internet account allegedly operated by Mr Bowers on Gab, a social media platform, made multiple anti-Semitic comments prior to the rampage, including as recently as Saturday morning. 
26	3	Synagogue shooting	Synagogue shooter screamed 'All Jews must die' before opening fire	The New York Post	https://nypost.com/2018/10/27/shooter-screamed-all-jews-must-die-before-opening-fire-at-pittsburgh-synagogue/	burst into a Pittsburgh synagogue during Sabbath services, shooting and killing at least 11 people and wounding a half-dozen more, including four police officers, before surrendering. The conservative Tree of Life Synagogue had been packed with three separate congregations attending Saturday morning services when the bloodbath began at around 10 am  Congregants told MSNBC that a bris, or circumcision ceremony had been in progress. Pennsylvania's Attorney General Josh Shapiro said the shooting happened during the portion of the ceremony when the child is given a Hebrew name. The suspect - identified by CBS affiliate KDKA as 46-year-old Robert Bowers, a bearded, heavyset resident of Pittsburgh - was armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle and two handguns, according to multiple reports. The gunfire sent congregants scattering, with many calling police after barricading themselves inside the building, located in the city's Jewish enclave Squirrel Hill. The investigation will be led by the FBI in Philadelphia, and the shooting has been classified a federal hate crime, he said. Vice President Mike Pence called for the death penalty, saying, "What happened in Pittsburgh today was not just criminal - it was evil."
