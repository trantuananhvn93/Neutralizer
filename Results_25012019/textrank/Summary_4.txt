When police arrived after reports of a shooting over the weekend at a bar outside Chicago, witnesses say Jemel Roberson, a 26-year-old security guard who worked there, had already subdued the alleged assailant in the parking lot, pinning him to the ground. But the" subject" was Roberson, not the suspect in the bar shooting. She said it was" absolutely clear" that he was a security guard. Four others at the bar, including the shooting suspect, sustained non-life-threatening injuries, police said. Roberson was the father of a 9-month-old son. She added that Roberson had dreamed of being a police officer." Roberson's family filed a lawsuit on Monday against the Midlothian police department and the officer who shot him, seeking damages of $ 1 million.
