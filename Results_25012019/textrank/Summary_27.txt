The suspected gunman behind Saturday's shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue, which left 11 people dead and six more injured, has been formally charged, prosecutors said. The bloody attack brought swift condemnation from President Trump and other leaders, and inspired a grim vigil in the city on Saturday night that attracted thousands. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center officials said a 61-year-old woman was among the injured. " She is said to be in good condition and recovering. " He was undergoing his second operation and in critical condition, hospital officials said. Meanwhile, police in New York and Los Angeles said they would be deploying extra teams to synagogues and Jewish locations throughout those cities.
