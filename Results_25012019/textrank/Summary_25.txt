Eleven people were killed Saturday morning during a mass-shooting at The Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that ended in the arrest of a single suspect, Robert Bowers, and the recovery of multiple weapons. The shooter, a 46-year-old Pittsburgh resident, likewise sustained injuries. The rampage unfolded during morning services, turning the Jewish house of worship into a gruesome crime scene the city's public safety director, Wendell Hissrich, compared to a" plane crash." The Tree of Life Synagogue reported an active shooting situation at 9:54 a.m. Saturday morning, and law enforcement officers were dispatched within seconds, Mr. Hissrich said at a press conference. The Tree of Life Synagogue hosts weekly services every Saturday morning, according to its website.
