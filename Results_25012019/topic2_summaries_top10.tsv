10	2	Florida midterm vote recount	One Day In, Florida's Senate Recount Gets Messier	The Huffington Post	https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-recount-rick-scott-bill-nelson_us_5be8b7f6e4b0769d24ceb6c9?guccounter=1	Rick Scott's campaign filed a handful of lawsuits seeking to give law enforcement custody of election equipment and prevent certain ballots from being included in official results. Scott accused Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections in Broward County, of violating state law by refusing to provide information to his campaign about the number of outstanding ballots. He also alleged Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County, had run afoul of state law by duplicating and damaging certain ballots. In a separate suit against Snipes, Scott's campaign asked a judge to block Broward County from counting any of the ballots it didn't include in the unofficial results it submitted to the Florida Department of State by noon Saturday, a deadline set by state law. Florida accepts vote-by-mail ballots until 7 pm on Election Day and the county may not have them all counted by Saturday's deadline. "If Rick Scott wanted to make sure every legal ballot is counted, he would not be suing to try and stop voters from having their legal ballot counted as intended," the campaign said in a statement. "In suing to seize ballots and impound voting machines, Rick Scott is doing his best to impersonate Latin American dictators who have overthrown Democracies in Venezuela and Cuba," Penalosa said. Nelson's campaign also has a lawsuit seeking to force the state to count ballots thrown out because the signature on them didn't match the one on file with the state's voter registration. In a televised statement in front of the governor's mansion Thursday evening, Scott suggested there was "rampant fraud" in Broward and Palm Beach counties and asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate. The state law enforcement agency said Friday it wasn't investigating any allegations of fraud, but Scott continued to insist in a television interview on Fox News Sunday that such fraud existed.
11	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Florida Officially Orders Statewide Recount in Senate and Governor's Races	Slate	https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/11/florida-election-recount-senate-governor-race-nelson-scott-desantis-gillum.html	The two marquee races in Florida remain so tight they are officially headed toward a recount, the state secretary of state, Ken Detzner-an appointee of current Florida governor and Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott-announced Saturday. As the state begins its second tally, the original count in the Senate race gives Scott an ever-so-slim 12,500-vote lead of 8 million votes cast over Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson. The recounts seemed inevitable as the races tightened in the aftermath of Tuesday's vote and became a certainty after the noon deadline Saturday for county election supervisors to submit their results passed with both races within the 0.5 percent margin that legally mandates a recount. In the governor's race, which stands at a 0.4 percent margin, a legally required machine recount will be undertaken. In the Senate race, because it's closer than 0.25 percent, an additional hand recount is required by law of votes that were not initially counted by the voting machines for whatever reason. The machine recount must be completed by Thursday at 5 pm "In Broward and Palm Beach counties Saturday morning, attorneys from both parties quibbled over ballots in which the intent or eligibility of the voter was in doubt as the minutes ticked toward a noon deadline," the Washington Post reports. "Officials from both parties have focused much of their ire on Brenda Snipes, supervisor of elections in Broward County, Florida's second-largest county and the site of the 'hanging chads' and other ballot irregularities during the 2000 presidential recount." The Florida Department of State has sent monitors to Broward County, which had tallied more than 700,000 votes as of Thursday afternoon, stemming from a lawsuit over the county's mishandling of 2016 congressional race ballots. Further complicating matters in the Senate race is a potential ballot design flaw that may have caused tens of thousands of voters to skip over the Senate contest in Broward County, which was buried underneath the ballot instructions. Roughly 10,000 fewer people voted in Broward County in the Senate race than for the commissioner of agriculture or the chief financial officer race, which is unusual.
12	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Andrew Gillum withdraws his concession as the Florida recount is officially on for three key races	Daily Kos	https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/11/10/1811855/-Andrew-Gillum-withdraws-his-concession-as-the-Florida-recount-is-officially-on-for-three-key-races	Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee and Democratic nominee for Florida governor, has withdrawn his Election Day concession to opponent and hero to racists, Ron DeSantis. "I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call we count every single vote," Gillum announced on Twitter Saturday, as well as in a press conference. Florida is doing a recount of votes. Earlier today, Ken Detzner, Florida's Secretary of State, announced that the state was doing a recount via machine. This recount applies to races across the state. The recount will also apply to the Senate race between Republican Governor Rick Scott and Democratic Senator, Bill Nelson. Since margins came in at under .5 percent in all three instances, all votes will be recounted by machine. This part of the process has to be wrapped up by Thursday, at 3 pm Additionally, if races come within a .25 percent margin, those votes trigger a recount by hand. Georgia and Arizona are also fighting to get every vote counted, with particular attention on Stacey Abrams, who has yet to concede to former Secretary of State Brian Kemp in Georgia's battle for governor. It's also a big deal on a symbolic level, as President Donald Trump seems to think not every vote matters, as shown by his snark on Twitter: "You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia - but the Election was on Tuesday?
13	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Florida Begins Vote Recounts in Senate and Governor's Races	The New York Times	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/us/florida-senate-governor-votes-recount.html	Florida began the first full, statewide vote recount in its history on Saturday after authorities found that tallies submitted by its 67 counties left the contests for Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner too close to call. Recounts were also ordered in a State Senate race and two contests for the State House, a measure of the slender margins in the nation's largest swing state that have left two of the most closely watched races in the country still undecided, four days after the midterm elections. The sight of grim-faced candidates, shouting protesters outside the Broward County elections office and lawyers flown in from Washington evoked memories of Florida's hotly contested recount over the 2000 presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore and capped off one of the most bitterly divisive midterm election seasons in years. In Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema, the Democratic candidate in the state's uncalled Senate race, expanded her lead on Friday to 20,203 votes over Martha McSally, the Republican contender - and thousands of ballots were still to be counted. Mr Scott, who has filed lawsuits against elections officials in Broward and Palm Beach Counties over the handling of ballots, made it clear he was not expecting to relinquish the seat he claimed on Tuesday night and suggested the latest results filed on Saturday had reconfirmed it. Mr Scott denounced the embattled Broward County elections supervisor, Brenda C Snipes, who, the campaign said Friday night, still refused to confirm whether she had counted all the ballots. Daniel A Smith, chairman of the political science department at the University of Florida, said 41,000 Floridians requested mail-in ballots from overseas, so elections supervisors were simply inundated with ballots to count after Election Day. Mr Scott claimed fraud in Broward County even though the state was monitoring Dr Snipes's office during the election. The odds that Mr Gillum, who trails by 0.41 percentage points, and even Mr Nelson, who is behind by about 0.15 percentage points, will find themselves on top after a recount seem low, according to veterans of Florida's presidential recount in 2000. Marc Elias, Mr Nelson's lawyer, has maintained that a machine error might still account for fewer votes for Mr Nelson - an issue that would only be caught in a manual recount.
14	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Mid-term elections 2018: Recounts descend into rancour	BBC News	https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46166980	Florida has ordered a machine recount of votes for state governor and senator following last week's closely fought mid-term elections, officials say. Mr Detzner has ordered that all 67 Florida counties complete machine recounts for the Senate and gubernatorial races by 15:00 local time on Thursday. In the race for Florida's Senate seat, unofficial results revealed a gap of just 0.15% between the votes for incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson and Mr Scott. Mr Scott, who claimed victory on Tuesday, is suing officials over an election recount, while Mr Nelson is suing over uncounted ballots - and there have also been a number of protests outside the elections office. Mr Scott called on sheriffs in every county to closely monitor the recount process, tweeting: "We will not let unethical liberals steal this election! Mr Nelson responded to the legal action in a statement on Sunday, saying his rival, the state's outgoing governor, was making "false and panicked" voter fraud claims because he was afraid of losing. Mr Trump told reporters on Friday, before leaving for Paris to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, that he believed that Mr Scott had clearly won the election. The president said he would send his lawyers to Florida "to expose the fraud", calling the Nelson campaign's recount lawyer Marc Elias an election stealer. Mr Gore's fate was finally sealed by a US Supreme Court ruling that said in essence that time had run out for recounts in the crucial state, granting Mr Bush the presidency. Mr Kemp declared victory on Wednesday with a narrow lead but campaign officials for Ms Abrams have started a legal challenge to ensure all votes are counted.
15	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Florida Senate and Governor Races Go to Recount	Bloomberg	https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-10/florida-orders-statewide-recount-on-senate-governor-races	Florida's Senate and governor's races have gone to a recount that will decide two key offices in the largest US swing state, setting off outcries from Republicans led by President Donald Trump and Rick Scott, the state's governor now vying to be a US Senator. In the Senate race, the unofficial count had Republican Scott leading incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson by about 12,600 votes among roughly 8.2 million votes cast in the Nov 6 election. Election workers on Saturday evening started a mad dash to recount by machine the millions of votes, in a task that some thought would be impossible to finish by the mandated deadline of 3 pm on Nov 15. Scott's "own Republican officials in Florida said there is no fraud," Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on CNN Sunday. Scott declared victory on election night, but slow vote-counting in Democrat-leaning Broward and Palm Beach counties narrowed the race to within the margin that dictates a recount. Trump, Scott and other Republicans have attempted to sow doubt about the process and raise suspicions about electoral officials, especially Broward County's election supervisor Brenda Snipes, who oversaw the vote in the state's second-most populous county, which includes Fort Lauderdale and Coral Springs. Pressed on ABC's "This Week" on Sunday to offer one piece of evidence that efforts are underway to "steal" the Florida election, as Trump tweeted Saturday, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway cited "boxes of votes just appearing out of nowhere" and past criticism of Snipes. The 2000 presidential election was decided when the US Supreme Court halted a Florida recount and made Republican George W Bush the winner over Democrat Al Gore. In addition to more sophisticated voting technology, the Florida Election Reform Act of 2001 created a mechanism to automatically trigger a recount within a certain threshold. The race for Florida's agriculture commissioner will go to a recount as well, with Democrat Nikki Fried now edging Republican Matt Caldwell by about 5,300 votes.
16	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Rick Scott insists he 'won the election,' as recount chaos keeps Florida races in suspense	Fox News	https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rick-scott-insists-he-won-the-election-as-election-chaos-keeps-florida-georgia-and-arizona-races-in-suspense	Florida Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott insisted Monday he "won the election" while accusing incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of trying to "steal" the race from him, amid chaotic recounts in the sunshine state's Senate and gubernatorial races. Over the weekend, Florida's secretary of state Ken Detzner announced there would be recounts in both the Senate race and the governor's race, noting that unofficial results in both races fell within the margin that by law triggers a recount. Scott, who is Florida's outgoing Republican governor, filed two bombshell lawsuits against election officials in two Democratic strongholds in Florida-Broward County and Palm Beach County-flagging them for engaging in potentially "rampant fraud." In the Florida governor's race, Republican candidate Ron DeSantis was announced the winner by the end of Election Day, with his Democratic opponent Andrew Gillum conceding on the night of the election. Both Scott and DeSantis led their races after the midterms on Tuesday, but as the days went on, and more votes were counted, those leads had all but disappeared. "The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. In Georgia's gubernatorial race, Republican Brian Kemp declared victory, though his Democratic opponent Stacey Abrams refused to concede and filed a federal lawsuit in an effort to force a runoff election. The Abrams campaign's lawsuit asked a judge to delay vote certifications in Georgia's unsettled governor's race by one day, and block counties from tossing some provisional and absentee ballots that may have minor mistakes on them. And in Arizona, the race to replace Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., has yet to be settled, as Democratic candidate Rep. Kyrsten Sinema increased her advantage over Republican candidate Rep. Martha McSally by more than 32,000 votes as of Sunday. "Kyrsten has now expanded her overall lead to 32,640 or 1.52 percent, meaning McSally would have to win the remainder of Maricopa ballots by 22 percent to take the lead in this race," Sinema spokesman Andrew Piatt said in a statement.
17	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Florida Orders Recount in Senate, Governor Races	Breitbart	https://www.breitbart.com/news/florida-orders-recount-in-senate-governor-races/	Florida authorities on Saturday ordered a statewide recount in the contentious races for US Senate and governor, amid tit-for-tat accusations of fraud from the candidates - plunging the state once again into election uncertainty. State law triggers a machine recount if the difference in a race is within 0.5 percent. After the cut-off, the Senate race between outgoing Republican governor Rick Scott and incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson was super close: Scott's lead stood at just 12,562 votes out of nearly 8.2 million cast, a margin of just 0.15 percent. In the governor's race, the latest unofficial results on the Florida division of elections website show Republican Ron DeSantis, who was backed by Donald Trump, leading Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum by just 33,684 votes out of more than 8.2 million cast, or a margin of 0.41 percent. In a statement, Detzner said the results of the machine recount would be due on November 15 at 3:00 pm (2000 GMT). With Florida's developments raising partisan tensions to fresh highs, Trump on Friday alleged a major corruption scandal was brewing. "Bad things are going on in Broward Country, really bad things," Trump added, referring to a Democrat-heavy county where officials were slowly counting votes including absentee and provisional ballots. On Saturday, he urged Florida's sheriffs to "watch for any violations during the recount process as outlined in Florida law." The recount is reminiscent of the dramatic recounts that occurred in parts of Florida after the 2000 presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore. Those recounts were halted by the US Supreme Court, and Bush defeated Gore by 537 votes in Florida to win the presidency.
18	2	Florida midterm vote recount	Florida orders recount for governor and Senate races	New York Post	https://nypost.com/2018/11/10/florida-orders-recount-for-governor-and-senate-races/	Florida election officials ordered statewide ballot recounts Saturday as ferocious battles over vote tallies left Senate and governor's races there in doubt. Unofficial vote totals submitted today at noon gave Republican Ron DeSantis a 0.4 percent edge over Democrat Andrew Gillum in the governor's race, triggering an automatic machine recount under state law. Republican Gov. Rick Scott's advantage over incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson in the fight for a seat in the US Senate was just 0.15 percent - 12,562 votes out of nearly 8.2 million cast. If the machine recount yields a margin of victory less than 0.25 percent, state law requires Florida to conduct a hand recount that could take weeks. In a statement issued shortly after the provisional totals were released, Scott urged Nelson to concede. "Bill Nelson's lawyer Marc Elias has previously stated that margins smaller than ours are 'insurmountable,'" Scott's campaign said. As news of the recount broke, Trump weighed in on Twitter. "Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! he stated.
