A police officer gunned down an armed black security guard who tried to stop a shooting at a suburban Chicago bar, according to reports Monday.
But cops who rushed to the bar mistook the guard for "one of the bad guys," witness Adam Harris told Fox32.
"The security guard that got killed, he caught somebody and had his knee on him the whole time," Harris told Fox32.
Walter Turner, a church friend, added, "How in the world does the security guard get shot by police?"
"It is the policy of the Midlothian Police Department to utilize the Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force for any officer-involved shootings so we can ensure transparency and maintain public trust," Midlothian police said in a statement, according to the newspaper.
