Robert Bowers, who opened fire at the Tree of Life Synagogue, in Pittsburgh, this morning, killing at least eleven people, was not evasive about his intent.
It has been marked, too, by mass murders in houses of worship-in recent years, the massacre of twenty-six people at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, last November, and the murder of nine African-American worshippers at Emanuel AME Church, in Charleston, South Carolina, by the white supremacist Dylann Roof.
On Wednesday afternoon, a man named Gregory Bush allegedly shot and killed two African-American customers at a Kroger's supermarket in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, reportedly saying afterward, "Whites don't kill whites."
But the massacres in Pittsburgh and Jeffersontown-and the pipe bombs sent to a dozen Democratic leaders this week, allegedly by the Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc-share some obvious common causes.
They are the toxic politics of the President, and the racist, nationalist fervor that has been inflamed by his rise, and the success and the militancy of the gun lobby, which for decades has refused to acknowledge the obvious: that one way to have fewer killings is to make it harder for Americans to possess guns.
