Florida's Senate and governor's races have gone to a recount that will decide two key offices in the largest US swing state, setting off outcries from Republicans led by President Donald Trump and Rick Scott, the state's governor now vying to be a US Senator.
In the Senate race, the unofficial count had Republican Scott leading incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson by about 12,600 votes among roughly 8.2 million votes cast in the Nov 6 election.
Trump, Scott and other Republicans have attempted to sow doubt about the process and raise suspicions about electoral officials, especially Broward County's election supervisor Brenda Snipes, who oversaw the vote in the state's second-most populous county, which includes Fort Lauderdale and Coral Springs.
Pressed on ABC's "This Week" on Sunday to offer one piece of evidence that efforts are underway to "steal" the Florida election, as Trump tweeted Saturday, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway cited "boxes of votes just appearing out of nowhere" and past criticism of Snipes.
The race for Florida's agriculture commissioner will go to a recount as well, with Democrat Nikki Fried now edging Republican Matt Caldwell by about 5,300 votes.
