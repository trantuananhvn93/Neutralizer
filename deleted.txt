 A security guard at an Illinois bar was shot and killed early Sunday by a police officer who arrived at the scene following reports of a shooting.
"Officers encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an Officer involved shooting," the statement, which does not identify the police officer, said.
She said she did not hear police tell Roberson to put his gun down.

 In the early hours of November 11, 26-year-old Jemel Roberson was working security at a bar in the Chicago suburbs when a shooting broke out.
News of Roberson's shooting comes amid a national conversation about racial disparities in police violence, and how it affects black men and women.
Coverage of Roberson's shooting has focused on exactly how long it took the officer to use his weapon after he arrived at the scene, and what commands, if any, were made before he opened fire.
Witness statements provided to media have suggested that the officer involved in the shooting did not react to cries that Roberson was a security guard.

 A police officer fatally shot an armed security guard who witnesses say was trying to detain a man following a shooting at a suburban Chicago bar, authorities said.

An officer responding from nearby Midlothian encountered and shot "a subject with a gun", the Midlothian police chief, Daniel Delaney, said in a statement.
The Rev Marvin Hunter said Roberson was an "upstanding young man" and a promising keyboard player who played at his and several other area churches.

But the "subject" was Roberson, not the suspect in the bar shooting.
"According to witness statements, the Midlothian Officer gave the armed subject multiple verbal commands to drop the gun and get on the ground before ultimately discharging his weapon and striking the subject," the statement said.
 Woods said that the Midlothian officer came out of the club's back door - weapon drawn - and ordered Roberson to "get on the ground."

Moments after police came on the scene, an officer opened fire on Roberson, who was black, killing him.
"The security guard that got killed, he caught somebody and had his knee on him the whole time," Mr Harris said.
I guess when the police got there, they probably thought he was one of the bad guys, cause he had his gun on the guy and they shot him."
The chief of the Midlothian police, whose officer fired the fatal shot, said in a statement: "Upon arrival officers learned there were several gunshot victims inside the bar."
"How in the world does the security guard get shot by police?"

 Robert Bowers, who opened fire at the Tree of Life Synagogue, in Pittsburgh, this morning, killing at least eleven people, was not evasive about his intent.
The Tree of Life shooting, however, was the second attempted hate-fuelled massacre in a house of worship within seventy-two hours.
Ten to fifteen minutes before, he had tried the predominantly black First Baptist Church, where he spent several minutes rattling the locked doors.
 Trump, asked about the Pittsburgh shooting, said, "If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better."
