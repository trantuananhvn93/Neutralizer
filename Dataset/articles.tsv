1	Accidental shooting	A Security Guard Who Stopped A Gunman At A Bar Was Shot And Killed By Responding Police	BuzzFeed News	https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maryanngeorgantopoulos/security-guard-illinois-bar-police-shot-killed-gun	A security guard at an Illinois bar was shot and killed early Sunday by a police officer who arrived at the scene following reports of a shooting. Jemel Roberson, 26, was shot by a Midlothian police officer who arrived at Manny's Blue Room Lounge in Robbins, Illinois, around 4 a.m. on Sunday. According to a statement by Midlothian Police Department Chief Daniel Delaney, officers who arrived at the scene "learned there were several gunshot victims inside the bar." "Officers encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an Officer involved shooting," the statement, which does not identify the police officer, said. Roberson was transported to a local hospital where he later died. It remains unclear exactly what happened inside the bar. One witness told WGN9 that a drunk patron who was asked to leave the bar returned with a gun and opened fire inside. According to witnesses who spoke to local reporters, Roberson apprehended the suspect until police arrived. "He had somebody on the ground with his knee in back, with his gun in his back like, 'Don’t move,'" witness Adam Harris told WGN9. "I guess when the police got there, they probably thought he was one of the bad guys, cause he had his gun on the guy and they shot him," Harris told Fox32. In a video Harris posted on his Facebook page showing the aftermath of the shooting, a man is seen laying on the asphalt as someone administers chest compressions. "He was just breathing," someone is heard saying in the video. Harris did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment. Another witness told reporters that the Roberson was standing over the suspect with his gun drawn. She said she did not hear police tell Roberson to put his gun down. Four other people, including the suspected shooter who reportedly instigated the incident inside the bar, sustained non-life-threatening injuries. According to a GoFundMe page, Roberson was "a gifted basketball player and musician, and his love for God and his family were at the forefront of his life." Roberson played music at the Purposed Church in Chicago for the past several years, according to Pastor LeAundre Hill, who tweeted that Roberson "had just played for my grandma's funeral Friday and now he's gone." "Every artist he’s ever played for, every musician he’s ever sat beside, we’re all just broken because we have no answers," the Rev. Patricia Hill of Purposed Church said. "He was getting ready to train and do all that stuff, so the very people he wanted to be family with, took his life." "Sadly, Jemel's life was tragically and unexpectedly cut short this morning as he tried to save others from senseless violence," the GoFundMe page reads. "Today, many remember him as a hero; one who put others before himself." The Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force is investigating the police-involved shooting. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
2	Accidental Shooting	A black security guard caught a shooting suspect — only to be shot by police minutes later	Vox	https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/11/12/18088874/jemel-roberson-police-shooting-security-guard-illinois	In the early hours of November 11, 26-year-old Jemel Roberson was working security at a bar in the Chicago suburbs when a shooting broke out. Shortly after Roberson subdued the suspect at gunpoint, police arrived — and fatally shot the armed security guard as he pinned the suspect to the ground. Roberson was working at Manny’s Blue Room Bar, in Robbins, Illinois, when security personnel asked a group of men to leave following an argument. Soon after, at least one man returned to the bar and began shooting, injuring some of the people in the bar. Security returned fire and Roberson detained the man. Roberson “had somebody on the ground with his knee in back, with his gun in his back, like, ‘Don’t move,’” witness Adam Harris told local news outlet WGN. When officers from the Robbins and Midlothian police departments arrived, one officer opened fire, killing Roberson. According to witness statements given to local outlets, the officer fired even as witnesses told them to stop. “Everybody was screaming out, ‘Security!’ He was a security guard,” Harris said. “They still did their job, and saw a black man with a gun, and basically killed him,” he added. In preliminary findings released on Tuesday, Illinois State Police (which is tasked with investigating the shooting) argued that the officer gave Roberson “multiple verbal commands” to drop his weapon before opening fire. “According to witness statements, the Midlothian Officer gave the armed subject multiple verbal commands to drop the gun and get on the ground before ultimately discharging his weapon and striking the subject,” state police said in a statement. The agency added that Roberson was not wearing anything that identified him as a security guard. Gregory Kulis, a lawyer representing Roberson’s mother in a civil rights lawsuit filed after the shooting, said that Roberson had a hat with the words “SECURITY” on it. Four other people, including a man believed to be the suspect behind the bar shooting, were injured in the incident. The suspect’s name has not been released publicly and he has not been charged yet, Sophia Ansari, a spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff’s Office, told CNN on Tuesday. On Tuesday, Midlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney issued a statement calling Roberson “a brave man who was doing his best to end an active shooter situation.” “The Midlothian Police Department is completely saddened by this tragic incident and we give our heartfelt condolences to Jemel, his family and his friends. There are no words that can be expressed as to the sorrow his family is dealing with,” Delaney added. He told the Chicago Tribune that the department will release another statement on the shooting “after the agency concluded its inquiry and ‘all of the facts’ are known.” NBC News reports that the officer who shot Roberson has been placed on administrative leave. The officer’s name has not been released, but the Chicago Tribune reports that the officer has been with the department for several years. News of Roberson’s shooting comes amid a national conversation about racial disparities in police violence, and how it affects black men and women. The shooting also calls attention to the dangers black gun owners face when interacting with police. Coverage of Roberson’s shooting has focused on exactly how long it took the officer to use his weapon after he arrived at the scene, and what commands, if any, were made before he opened fire. Witness statements provided to media have suggested that the officer involved in the shooting did not react to cries that Roberson was a security guard. But the statement from the state police argues that the responding officer had no way to know Roberson was security and that he only fired after Roberson did not respond to commands. Dorian Myrickes, a colleague of Roberson’s and one of the people injured in the initial gunfight, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that he did not hear the police officer issue any commands. “I never heard the cop demand him to do anything, (but) everybody was telling him (Jemel) was security,” Myrickes told the AP. The AP reports that video footage of the shooting could help clear up some details, but it is unclear if that footage exists. Kulis, the lawyer representing Roberson’s family, has filed a motion with a judge that seeks to preserve any footage the departments may have. The shooting has prompted confusion and anger among those who knew Roberson. “How in the world does the security guard get shot by police?” asked Walter Turner, a pastor at Chicago’s New Spiritual Light Baptist Church, one of several churches where Roberson assisted as a musician, during an interview with ABC7 Chicago. “A young man that was literally doing his job and now he’s gone.” Others who knew Roberson say that the shooting reinforces their belief that police are too quick to use force. “It’s the continued narrative that we see of shoot first, ask questions later,” said Rev. LeAundre Hill of Purposed Church, another church where Roberson assisted, told WGN. A spokesperson for the Cook County Sheriff’s Office, which is assisting with investigating the initial bar shooting, said that Roberson had a valid firearm owners ID card, but did not have a concealed carry license. Roberson’s family filed a federal civil rights lawsuit on Monday. The suit was filed by Roberson’s mother and names the village of Midlothian and the unnamed officer as defendants. The lawsuit says that the shooting was “excessive and unreasonable,” and seeks more than $1 million in damages. Roberson’s death is the latest incident in recent years where a black gun owner was fatally shot by police. In July 2016, after telling a Minnesota police officer that he was carrying a legal firearm when he was pulled over, Philando Castile was shot while reaching for his wallet. In July, Harith Augustus, a black barber working in Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood, was shot by Chicago police after an officer stopped the man and questioned him for “exhibiting characteristics of an armed person.” Video showed Augustus attempting to show an officer what appeared to be an Illinois firearm owner’s ID, before being startled by an officer attempting to grab him from behind. ThinkProgress’s Lindsay Gibbs notes that Roberson’s death suggests that the calls for more armed guards that so often emerge after mass shootings carry a unique risk for black people. “Roberson was both an armed security guard and a good guy with a gun. He risked his life to apprehend a shooter. And police killed him anyway,” Gibbs writes. Patricia Hill, another pastor at Purposed Church, said that Roberson wanted to become a police officer, calling it a tragedy that he was killed in a police shooting. “He was getting ready to train and do all that stuff, so the very people he wanted to be family with, took his life.”
3	Accidental Shooting	Officer fatally shoots security guard who detained gunman at suburban Chicago bar	The Guardian	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/12/officer-fatally-shoots-security-guard-chicago-suburbs-bar	A police officer fatally shot an armed security guard who witnesses say was trying to detain a man following a shooting at a suburban Chicago bar, authorities said. Investigators said 26-year-old Jemel Roberson was pronounced dead shortly after being taken to a hospital following the shooting early on Sunday at Manny’s Blue Room in Robbins, just south of Chicago. Four other people were shot and wounded during the incident, including a man who police believe fired a gun before police arrived, the Cook county sheriff’s spokeswoman, Sophia Ansari, said. When police arrived at the scene, Roberson was holding “somebody on the ground with his knee in his back, with his gun in his back,” witness Adam Harris told WGN-TV. “Everybody is screaming out, ‘He’s a security guard,’” Harris said. Roberson was licensed to carry a firearm, Ansari said. Charges were pending on Monday against the man who investigators believe fired the initial shots during a dispute. His name has yet to be released, and he remained hospitalized on Monday, Ansari said. Investigators said the initial gunfire was reported around 4am. An officer responding from nearby Midlothian encountered and shot “a subject with a gun”, the Midlothian police chief, Daniel Delaney, said in a statement. The person was later identified as Roberson. No details have been released about the officer. Roberson, who was black, was the only person killed in the shooting. The other four people who were shot suffered wounds that were not considered life-threatening, Ansari said. The Rev Marvin Hunter said Roberson was an “upstanding young man” and a promising keyboard player who played at his and several other area churches. Roberson was working to “enough money together for a deposit on a new apartment”, said Hunter, the great uncle of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager fatally shot in 2014 by a white Chicago police officer. Illinois state police are handling the investigation into Roberson’s shooting. The agency said it would not comment on the investigation until it is completed.
4	Accidental Shooting	Police Fatally Shoot Black Security Guard Who Detained Shooting Suspect	NPR	https://www.npr.org/2018/11/13/667252788/police-fatally-shoot-black-security-guard-who-detained-suspected-shooter?t=1542105437068&t=1543335371240	When police arrived after reports of a shooting over the weekend at a bar outside Chicago, witnesses say Jemel Roberson, a 26-year-old security guard who worked there, had already subdued the alleged assailant in the parking lot, pinning him to the ground. Adam Harris, who was at Manny's Blue Bar in Robbins at the time of the incident on Sunday, told WGN-TV that Roberson was holding "somebody on the ground with his knee in his back, with his gun in his back" when officers from neighboring Midlothian got there early Sunday. Midlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney said that's when one of his officers "encountered a subject with a gun" and shot him, according to a statement given to the media. But the "subject" was Roberson, not the suspect in the bar shooting. On Tuesday, Illinois State Police issued a statement saying that "a Midlothian Police Officer encountered a subject in plain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a Security Guard, armed with a gun in the west parking lot." "According to witness statements, the Midlothian Officer gave the armed subject multiple verbal commands to drop the gun and get on the ground before ultimately discharging his weapon and striking the subject," the statement said. Roberson was holding a firearm he was licensed to carry. Other witnesses, and a lawsuit filed by Roberson's family, reportedly said he was wearing a hat emblazoned with the word "security." "Everybody was screaming out 'Security!' " Harris told WGN. "And they still did their job, and saw a black man with a gun, and basically killed him." Another witness, Jakia Woods, told member station WBEZ's Miles Bryan that Roberson was wearing an orange vest and the hat marked "security." She said it was "absolutely clear" that he was a security guard. Woods said that the Midlothian officer came out of the club's back door — weapon drawn — and ordered Roberson to "get on the ground." "Before he says 'ground' he fires the first shot," she said, adding that she has not been interviewed by investigators. Roberson was declared dead shortly after arriving at a hospital. Four others at the bar, including the shooting suspect, sustained non-life-threatening injuries, police said. Delaney said that the Cook County Sheriff's Office and the Robbins Police Department were investigating the shooting. Roberson was the father of a 9-month-old son. "This was going to be my baby's first Christmas with his dad and now he's going to miss out on everything," Avontea Boose, the child's mother, told The Associated Press. Roberson was also a musician for churches in his community. "Every artist he's ever played for, every musician he's ever sat beside, we're all just broken because we have no answers," the Rev. Patricia Hill told WGN. She added that Roberson had dreamed of being a police officer. "He was getting ready to train and do all that stuff, so the very people he wanted to be family with, took his life," Hill said. Roberson's family filed a lawsuit on Monday against the Midlothian police department and the officer who shot him, seeking damages of $1 million. A GoFundMe page has been established to raise money for funeral costs. Family and friends held a vigil Monday evening at the nightclub where he was killed.
5	Accidental Shooting	Outcry after police shoot African-American security guard 'hero'	BBC News	https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46187460	An armed security guard at a bar in suburban Chicago was killed by police as he detained a suspected gunman, according to officials and witnesses. After gunfire erupted around 04:00 local time on Sunday, Jemel Roberson, 26, chased down an attacker and knelt on his back until police arrived. Moments after police came on the scene, an officer opened fire on Roberson, who was black, killing him. Friends say Roberson was a musician who had dreams of joining the police. "The very people that he wanted to be family with took his life," Patricia Hill, the pastor of Purposed Hill church in Chicago, told WGN-TV. Roberson worked as a gospel musician at several nearby churches, and also had found work at Manny's Blue Room in Robbins, Illinois, where the shooting occurred. Sophia Ansari, a spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's office, said police were called to the scene after a fight broke out in the bar and four people were shot. Witness Adam Harris told Fox32 that Roberson, who was armed with a legally owned firearm, then chased down and caught one of the attackers. "The security guard that got killed, he caught somebody and had his knee on him the whole time," Mr Harris said. "Just waiting on the police to get there. I guess when the police got there, they probably thought he was one of the bad guys, cause he had his gun on the guy and they shot him." "Everybody was screaming out 'security, he was a security guard'", Mr Harris added, "and they still did their job and saw a black man with a gun and basically killed him". Images on social media show a chaotic scene outside the bar as witnesses shouted at police. "He was protecting the club and holding a suspect down," Mr Harris told CBS. The chief of the Midlothian police, whose officer fired the fatal shot, said in a statement: "Upon arrival officers learned there were several gunshot victims inside the bar." Chief Dan Delaney continued: "A Midlothian officer encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an officer-involved shooting." Illinois State Police's Public Integrity Taskforce have been asked to investigate the shooting, Ms Ansari told the BBC. She added that the other four who were shot - including the offender" - suffered injuries that did not appear to be life-threatening. Acquaintances say Roberson was a spiritual man, who played organ at several churches in southern Chicago. "How in the world does the security guard get shot by police?" New Spiritual Light Baptist Church Pastor Walter Turner told ABC7 News. "A young man that was literally doing his job and now he's gone." An online fundraiser set up for Roberson's burial expenses had raised over $12,000 (£9,300) as of Monday. "Jemel was a gifted basketball player and musician, and his love for God and his family were at the forefront of his life," according to the GoFundMe page. "Sadly, Jemel's life was tragically and unexpectedly cut short this morning as he tried to save others from senseless violence." According to FBI data, a disproportionately high proportion of police shootings in the US involve black people.
6	Accidental Shooting	Black Security Guard Responding to Shooting Is Killed by Police	The New York Times	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/police-officer-shoots-security-guard-chicago.html	A black security guard at a bar in the Chicago suburbs was killed by the police as he apparently tried to detain a man he believed to be involved in a shooting, the authorities said Monday. Officers from several police departments had responded to reports of a shooting early Sunday morning at Manny’s Luxury Lounge in Robbins, Ill., said Sophia Ansari, a spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff’s Office. Witnesses told the police that a fight had broken out and someone had started shooting. After the authorities responded, a police officer shot the guard, Jemel Roberson, 26, who had a gun, Ms. Ansari said. Mr. Roberson died at the hospital. Witnesses said that people in the crowd had yelled to arriving police officers that Mr. Roberson, who was wearing gear that read “Security,” was a guard. Ms. Ansari confirmed that Mr. Roberson worked for the bar. “Everybody was screaming out, ‘Security!’,” one witness, Adam Harris, told WGN-TV. “He was a security guard. And they still did their job, and saw a black man with a gun, and basically killed him.” This episode happened as many Republican politicians, including President Trump, have responded to mass shootings across the United States by calling for more people to protectively carry guns. After a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue left 11 people dead, Mr. Trump suggested that people carrying firearms during services would have helped. Ms. Ansari said that five people were shot during the episode at the bar. The injuries sustained by four of those people, including the man believed to have initially opened fire, were not life threatening, she said. An officer with the Midlothian Police Department shot Mr. Roberson, Ms. Ansari said. The Midlothian police chief, Dan Delaney, confirmed in a statement that one of his officers had shot a “subject with a gun.” He did not name the officer. On Monday, Mr. Roberson’s mother, Beatrice Roberson, filed a federal lawsuit against the unnamed police officer and the village of Midlothian. It alleges that the shooting was unprovoked, unjustified, excessive and unreasonable. Ms. Ansari said the man who initially opened fire at the bar had not yet been charged. She said he was still at a hospital. The shooting of Mr. Roberson is being investigated by the Illinois State Police, who did not return a call for comment. Family friends of Mr. Roberson’s said he had worked as an organist at several local churches and had once dreamed of becoming a police officer himself, according to local news reports. Mr. Roberson had a state firearm owner’s identification card, Ms. Ansari said, which authorized his possession of firearms. Mr. Roberson had planned to play later that day at New Spiritual Light Baptist Church, the pastor, Walter Turner, told the local ABC affiliate. “How in the world does the security guard get shot by the police?” Pastor Turner said. “A young man that was literally just doing his job, and now he’s gone.”
7	Accidental Shooting	Cop accidentally kills security guard at bar in Chicago suburbs: report	Fox News	https://www.foxnews.com/us/cop-accidentally-kills-security-guard-at-bar-in-chicago-suburbs	A police officer mistakenly shot and killed a security guard at a bar in Chicago's south suburbs early Sunday morning, Chicago’s Fox 32 reported. Witnesses said a security guard told a group of "drunk men" to leave a Robbins bar around 4 a.m. An armed suspect later came back inside the bar and opened fire, WGN-TV reported, citing witnesses. Armed security guards returned fire, the report said. One the guards -- Jemel Roberson, 26 -- apprehended the suspect outside, witnesses said. Roberson then requested help from Midlothian Police, the Cook County Sheriff's Office said. A witness told the station that Roberson was holding the suspect on the ground when one of two responding officers fatally shot him. "The security guard that got killed, he caught somebody and had his knee on him the whole time," said one witness cited by Fox 32. "Just waiting on the police to get there. I guess when the police got there, they probably thought he was one of the bad guys, cause he had his gun on the guy and they shot him." Four other people, including the shooter, suffered non-life threatening injuries, WGN-TV reported. Midlothian police confirmed that one of its two responding officers opened fire. The officer's identity was not released. Roberson was reportedly a church organist who was training to become a police officer. "He was getting ready to train and do all that stuff,  so the very people he wanted to be family with took his life," said Pastor Patricia Hill of Purposed Church. The Cook County Sheriff's Office is investigating the first shooting, while the State Police Public Integrity Task Force is investigating the police shooting. Robbins is a sparsely-populated village about a 30-minute drive south of Chicago. The shooting coincided with another violent weekend in Chicago with 20 shot -- including 3 fatally, The Chicago Sun-Times reported. The fatalities began early Saturday when a 29-year-old man was shot at a restaurant in the city's Far South Side, the report said. On Saturday evening, a 42-year-old man died inside his South Green Street apartment when someone took out a gun and shot him during a dice game, the Cook County medical examiner's office said. A 24-year-old man on Sunday evening was shot by an unidentified gunman multiple times in the chest and abdomen, the report said. Police said at least 17 others have been wounded from gun violence since Friday evening.
8	Accidental Shooting	Lawsuit alleges security guard shot while holding suspect	Daily Mail	https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6381075/Illinois-officer-responds-gunfire-fatally-shoots-guard.html	A police officer fatally shot an armed security guard who was wearing a hat with "security" emblazoned across the front and holding a man down following a shooting inside the suburban Chicago bar where the guard worked, an attorney for the guard's family said Monday after filing a federal lawsuit. Jemel Roberson, 26, was pronounced dead shortly after being taken to a hospital early Sunday following the shooting at Manny's Blue Room in Robbins, just south of Chicago. Four others were shot and wounded, including a man who police believe fired a gun before police arrived, Cook County sheriff's spokeswoman Sophia Ansari said. When police arrived at the scene, Roberson was holding "somebody on the ground with his knee in his back, with his gun in his back," witness Adam Harris told WGN-TV.

Charges were pending against the man who investigators believe fired the initial shots during a dispute. His name has yet to be released, and he remained hospitalized Monday, Ansari said. Investigators said the initial gunfire was reported around 4 a.m. An officer responding from nearby Midlothian encountered and shot "a subject with a gun," Midlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney said in a statement. The person was later identified as Roberson. No details have been released about the officer. Roberson, who was black, was the only person killed. The other four people who were shot suffered wounds that weren't considered life-threatening, Ansari said. Attorney Gregory Kulis filed a civil rights lawsuit seeking more than $1 million on behalf of Roberson's mother, Beatrice Roberson. He said Jemel Roberson was dressed in black but wearing a hat with the word "security" when he was shot. Kulis also echoed witness reports that Roberson was holding down another man outside the bar when the officer arrived and shot him. The Rev. Marvin Hunter said Roberson was "an upstanding young man" and a promising keyboard player at his and several other area churches. Roberson was trying to "get enough money together for a deposit on a new apartment," said Hunter, the great uncle of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager fatally shot by a white Chicago police officer in a high-profile 2014 case. Roberson also had hopes of someday becoming a police officer, according to his son's mother. "This was going to be my baby's first Christmas with his dad and now he's going to miss out on everything," said Avontea Boose. Illinois State Police are handling the investigation into Roberson's shooting. The agency said it would not comment on the investigation until it is completed.
9	Accidental Shooting	Cop fatally shoots security guard at bar in Chicago suburbs	New York Post 	https://nypost.com/2018/11/12/cop-fatally-shoots-security-guard-at-bar-in-chicago-suburbs/	A police officer gunned down an armed black security guard who tried to stop a shooting at a suburban Chicago bar, according to reports Monday. The 26-year-old guard, Jemel Roberson, had restrained a thug involved in the shooting outside Manny’s Blue Room in Robbins, Ill., after gunfire broke out at 4 a.m. Sunday, according to local station Fox32. But cops who rushed to the bar mistook the guard for “one of the bad guys,” witness Adam Harris told Fox32. “Everybody was screaming out, ‘Security! He is a security guard!’ ” Harris told the local station. “They … saw a black man with a gun and basically killed him.” Earlier in the night, security workers had asked a group of drunken men to leave the bar, and they later returned with a gun, according to WGN-TV. Roberson tackled one of the men and held him on the ground as he waited for cops to arrive, Harris said. “The security guard that got killed, he caught somebody and had his knee on him the whole time,” Harris told Fox32. “Just waiting on the police to get there. I guess when the police got there, they probably thought he was one of the bad guys, ’cause he had his gun on the guy and they shot him,” he said. Roberson was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he died, according to the station. Four other people, including the suspected gunman, were shot and suffered non-life-threatening injuries. In a tragic twist, Roberson had long dreamed of becoming a cop, said friends and members of his church. “The very people that he wanted to be family with took his life,” Patricia Hill, the pastor of his church, told WGN-TV. Walter Turner, a church friend, added, “How in the world does the security guard get shot by police?” “[He was] a young man that was literally doing his job and now he’s gone,” he told ABC Chicago. The Midlothian Police Department is investigating the police-involved shooting, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. “It is the policy of the Midlothian Police Department to utilize the Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force for any officer-involved shootings so we can ensure transparency and maintain public trust,” Midlothian police said in a statement, according to the newspaper.
