1	Accidental shooting	A Security Guard Who Stopped A Gunman At A Bar Was Shot And Killed By Responding Police	BuzzFeed News	https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maryanngeorgantopoulos/security-guard-illinois-bar-police-shot-killed-gun	A security guard at an Illinois bar was shot and killed early Sunday by a police officer who arrived at the scene following reports of a shooting. Jemel Roberson, 26, was shot by a Midlothian police officer who arrived at Manny's Blue Room Lounge in Robbins, Illinois, around 4 a.m. on Sunday. According to a statement by Midlothian Police Department Chief Daniel Delaney, officers who arrived at the scene "learned there were several gunshot victims inside the bar." "Officers encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an Officer involved shooting," the statement, which does not identify the police officer, said. Roberson was transported to a local hospital where he later died. It remains unclear exactly what happened inside the bar. One witness told WGN9 that a drunk patron who was asked to leave the bar returned with a gun and opened fire inside. According to witnesses who spoke to local reporters, Roberson apprehended the suspect until police arrived. "He had somebody on the ground with his knee in back, with his gun in his back like, 'Don't move,'" witness Adam Harris told WGN9. "I guess when the police got there, they probably thought he was one of the bad guys, cause he had his gun on the guy and they shot him," Harris told Fox32. In a video Harris posted on his Facebook page showing the aftermath of the shooting, a man is seen laying on the asphalt as someone administers chest compressions. "He was just breathing," someone is heard saying in the video. Harris did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment. Another witness told reporters that the Roberson was standing over the suspect with his gun drawn. She said she did not hear police tell Roberson to put his gun down. Four other people, including the suspected shooter who reportedly instigated the incident inside the bar, sustained non-life-threatening injuries. According to a GoFundMe page, Roberson was "a gifted basketball player and musician, and his love for God and his family were at the forefront of his life." Roberson played music at the Purposed Church in Chicago for the past several years, according to Pastor LeAundre Hill, who tweeted that Roberson "had just played for my grandma's funeral Friday and now he's gone." "Every artist he's ever played for, every musician he's ever sat beside, we're all just broken because we have no answers," the Rev. Patricia Hill of Purposed Church said. "He was getting ready to train and do all that stuff, so the very people he wanted to be family with, took his life." "Sadly, Jemel's life was tragically and unexpectedly cut short this morning as he tried to save others from senseless violence," the GoFundMe page reads. "Today, many remember him as a hero; one who put others before himself." The Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force is investigating the police-involved shooting. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
2	Accidental Shooting	A black security guard caught a shooting suspect - only to be shot by police minutes later	Vox	https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/11/12/18088874/jemel-roberson-police-shooting-security-guard-illinois	In the early hours of November 11, 26-year-old Jemel Roberson was working security at a bar in the Chicago suburbs when a shooting broke out. Shortly after Roberson subdued the suspect at gunpoint, police arrived - and fatally shot the armed security guard as he pinned the suspect to the ground. Roberson was working at Manny's Blue Room Bar, in Robbins, Illinois, when security personnel asked a group of men to leave following an argument. Soon after, at least one man returned to the bar and began shooting, injuring some of the people in the bar. Security returned fire and Roberson detained the man. Roberson "had somebody on the ground with his knee in back, with his gun in his back, like, 'Don't move,'" witness Adam Harris told local news outlet WGN. When officers from the Robbins and Midlothian police departments arrived, one officer opened fire, killing Roberson. According to witness statements given to local outlets, the officer fired even as witnesses told them to stop. "Everybody was screaming out, 'Security!' He was a security guard," Harris said. "They still did their job, and saw a black man with a gun, and basically killed him," he added. In preliminary findings released on Tuesday, Illinois State Police (which is tasked with investigating the shooting) argued that the officer gave Roberson "multiple verbal commands" to drop his weapon before opening fire. "According to witness statements, the Midlothian Officer gave the armed subject multiple verbal commands to drop the gun and get on the ground before ultimately discharging his weapon and striking the subject," state police said in a statement. The agency added that Roberson was not wearing anything that identified him as a security guard. Gregory Kulis, a lawyer representing Roberson's mother in a civil rights lawsuit filed after the shooting, said that Roberson had a hat with the words "SECURITY" on it. Four other people, including a man believed to be the suspect behind the bar shooting, were injured in the incident. The suspect's name has not been released publicly and he has not been charged yet, Sophia Ansari, a spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's Office, told CNN on Tuesday. On Tuesday, Midlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney issued a statement calling Roberson "a brave man who was doing his best to end an active shooter situation." "The Midlothian Police Department is completely saddened by this tragic incident and we give our heartfelt condolences to Jemel, his family and his friends. There are no words that can be expressed as to the sorrow his family is dealing with," Delaney added. He told the Chicago Tribune that the department will release another statement on the shooting "after the agency concluded its inquiry and 'all of the facts' are known." NBC News reports that the officer who shot Roberson has been placed on administrative leave. The officer's name has not been released, but the Chicago Tribune reports that the officer has been with the department for several years. News of Roberson's shooting comes amid a national conversation about racial disparities in police violence, and how it affects black men and women. The shooting also calls attention to the dangers black gun owners face when interacting with police. Coverage of Roberson's shooting has focused on exactly how long it took the officer to use his weapon after he arrived at the scene, and what commands, if any, were made before he opened fire. Witness statements provided to media have suggested that the officer involved in the shooting did not react to cries that Roberson was a security guard. But the statement from the state police argues that the responding officer had no way to know Roberson was security and that he only fired after Roberson did not respond to commands. Dorian Myrickes, a colleague of Roberson's and one of the people injured in the initial gunfight, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that he did not hear the police officer issue any commands. "I never heard the cop demand him to do anything, (but) everybody was telling him (Jemel) was security," Myrickes told the AP. The AP reports that video footage of the shooting could help clear up some details, but it is unclear if that footage exists. Kulis, the lawyer representing Roberson's family, has filed a motion with a judge that seeks to preserve any footage the departments may have. The shooting has prompted confusion and anger among those who knew Roberson. "How in the world does the security guard get shot by police?" asked Walter Turner, a pastor at Chicago's New Spiritual Light Baptist Church, one of several churches where Roberson assisted as a musician, during an interview with ABC7 Chicago. "A young man that was literally doing his job and now he's gone." Others who knew Roberson say that the shooting reinforces their belief that police are too quick to use force. "It's the continued narrative that we see of shoot first, ask questions later," said Rev. LeAundre Hill of Purposed Church, another church where Roberson assisted, told WGN. A spokesperson for the Cook County Sheriff's Office, which is assisting with investigating the initial bar shooting, said that Roberson had a valid firearm owners ID card, but did not have a concealed carry license. Roberson's family filed a federal civil rights lawsuit on Monday. The suit was filed by Roberson's mother and names the village of Midlothian and the unnamed officer as defendants. The lawsuit says that the shooting was "excessive and unreasonable," and seeks more than $1 million in damages. Roberson's death is the latest incident in recent years where a black gun owner was fatally shot by police. In July 2016, after telling a Minnesota police officer that he was carrying a legal firearm when he was pulled over, Philando Castile was shot while reaching for his wallet. In July, Harith Augustus, a black barber working in Chicago's South Shore neighborhood, was shot by Chicago police after an officer stopped the man and questioned him for "exhibiting characteristics of an armed person." Video showed Augustus attempting to show an officer what appeared to be an Illinois firearm owner's ID, before being startled by an officer attempting to grab him from behind. ThinkProgress's Lindsay Gibbs notes that Roberson's death suggests that the calls for more armed guards that so often emerge after mass shootings carry a unique risk for black people. "Roberson was both an armed security guard and a good guy with a gun. He risked his life to apprehend a shooter. And police killed him anyway," Gibbs writes. Patricia Hill, another pastor at Purposed Church, said that Roberson wanted to become a police officer, calling it a tragedy that he was killed in a police shooting. "He was getting ready to train and do all that stuff, so the very people he wanted to be family with, took his life."
3	Accidental Shooting	Officer fatally shoots security guard who detained gunman at suburban Chicago bar	The Guardian	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/12/officer-fatally-shoots-security-guard-chicago-suburbs-bar	A police officer fatally shot an armed security guard who witnesses say was trying to detain a man following a shooting at a suburban Chicago bar, authorities said. Investigators said 26-year-old Jemel Roberson was pronounced dead shortly after being taken to a hospital following the shooting early on Sunday at Manny's Blue Room in Robbins, just south of Chicago. Four other people were shot and wounded during the incident, including a man who police believe fired a gun before police arrived, the Cook county sheriff's spokeswoman, Sophia Ansari, said. When police arrived at the scene, Roberson was holding "somebody on the ground with his knee in his back, with his gun in his back," witness Adam Harris told WGN-TV. "Everybody is screaming out, 'He's a security guard,'" Harris said. Roberson was licensed to carry a firearm, Ansari said. Charges were pending on Monday against the man who investigators believe fired the initial shots during a dispute. His name has yet to be released, and he remained hospitalized on Monday, Ansari said. Investigators said the initial gunfire was reported around 4am. An officer responding from nearby Midlothian encountered and shot "a subject with a gun", the Midlothian police chief, Daniel Delaney, said in a statement. The person was later identified as Roberson. No details have been released about the officer. Roberson, who was black, was the only person killed in the shooting. The other four people who were shot suffered wounds that were not considered life-threatening, Ansari said. The Rev Marvin Hunter said Roberson was an "upstanding young man" and a promising keyboard player who played at his and several other area churches. Roberson was working to "enough money together for a deposit on a new apartment", said Hunter, the great uncle of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager fatally shot in 2014 by a white Chicago police officer. Illinois state police are handling the investigation into Roberson's shooting. The agency said it would not comment on the investigation until it is completed.
4	Accidental Shooting	Police Fatally Shoot Black Security Guard Who Detained Shooting Suspect	NPR	https://www.npr.org/2018/11/13/667252788/police-fatally-shoot-black-security-guard-who-detained-suspected-shooter?t=1542105437068&t=1543335371240	When police arrived after reports of a shooting over the weekend at a bar outside Chicago, witnesses say Jemel Roberson, a 26-year-old security guard who worked there, had already subdued the alleged assailant in the parking lot, pinning him to the ground. Adam Harris, who was at Manny's Blue Bar in Robbins at the time of the incident on Sunday, told WGN-TV that Roberson was holding "somebody on the ground with his knee in his back, with his gun in his back" when officers from neighboring Midlothian got there early Sunday. Midlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney said that's when one of his officers "encountered a subject with a gun" and shot him, according to a statement given to the media. But the "subject" was Roberson, not the suspect in the bar shooting. On Tuesday, Illinois State Police issued a statement saying that "a Midlothian Police Officer encountered a subject in plain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a Security Guard, armed with a gun in the west parking lot." "According to witness statements, the Midlothian Officer gave the armed subject multiple verbal commands to drop the gun and get on the ground before ultimately discharging his weapon and striking the subject," the statement said. Roberson was holding a firearm he was licensed to carry. Other witnesses, and a lawsuit filed by Roberson's family, reportedly said he was wearing a hat emblazoned with the word "security." "Everybody was screaming out 'Security!' " Harris told WGN. "And they still did their job, and saw a black man with a gun, and basically killed him." Another witness, Jakia Woods, told member station WBEZ's Miles Bryan that Roberson was wearing an orange vest and the hat marked "security." She said it was "absolutely clear" that he was a security guard. Woods said that the Midlothian officer came out of the club's back door - weapon drawn - and ordered Roberson to "get on the ground." "Before he says 'ground' he fires the first shot," she said, adding that she has not been interviewed by investigators. Roberson was declared dead shortly after arriving at a hospital. Four others at the bar, including the shooting suspect, sustained non-life-threatening injuries, police said. Delaney said that the Cook County Sheriff's Office and the Robbins Police Department were investigating the shooting. Roberson was the father of a 9-month-old son. "This was going to be my baby's first Christmas with his dad and now he's going to miss out on everything," Avontea Boose, the child's mother, told The Associated Press. Roberson was also a musician for churches in his community. "Every artist he's ever played for, every musician he's ever sat beside, we're all just broken because we have no answers," the Rev. Patricia Hill told WGN. She added that Roberson had dreamed of being a police officer. "He was getting ready to train and do all that stuff, so the very people he wanted to be family with, took his life," Hill said. Roberson's family filed a lawsuit on Monday against the Midlothian police department and the officer who shot him, seeking damages of $1 million. A GoFundMe page has been established to raise money for funeral costs. Family and friends held a vigil Monday evening at the nightclub where he was killed.
5	Accidental Shooting	Outcry after police shoot African-American security guard 'hero'	BBC News	https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46187460	An armed security guard at a bar in suburban Chicago was killed by police as he detained a suspected gunman, according to officials and witnesses. After gunfire erupted around 04:00 local time on Sunday, Jemel Roberson, 26, chased down an attacker and knelt on his back until police arrived. Moments after police came on the scene, an officer opened fire on Roberson, who was black, killing him. Friends say Roberson was a musician who had dreams of joining the police. "The very people that he wanted to be family with took his life," Patricia Hill, the pastor of Purposed Hill church in Chicago, told WGN-TV. Roberson worked as a gospel musician at several nearby churches, and also had found work at Manny's Blue Room in Robbins, Illinois, where the shooting occurred. Sophia Ansari, a spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's office, said police were called to the scene after a fight broke out in the bar and four people were shot. Witness Adam Harris told Fox32 that Roberson, who was armed with a legally owned firearm, then chased down and caught one of the attackers. "The security guard that got killed, he caught somebody and had his knee on him the whole time," Mr Harris said. "Just waiting on the police to get there. I guess when the police got there, they probably thought he was one of the bad guys, cause he had his gun on the guy and they shot him." "Everybody was screaming out 'security, he was a security guard'", Mr Harris added, "and they still did their job and saw a black man with a gun and basically killed him". Images on social media show a chaotic scene outside the bar as witnesses shouted at police. "He was protecting the club and holding a suspect down," Mr Harris told CBS. The chief of the Midlothian police, whose officer fired the fatal shot, said in a statement: "Upon arrival officers learned there were several gunshot victims inside the bar." Chief Dan Delaney continued: "A Midlothian officer encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an officer-involved shooting." Illinois State Police's Public Integrity Taskforce have been asked to investigate the shooting, Ms Ansari told the BBC. She added that the other four who were shot - including the offender" - suffered injuries that did not appear to be life-threatening. Acquaintances say Roberson was a spiritual man, who played organ at several churches in southern Chicago. "How in the world does the security guard get shot by police?" New Spiritual Light Baptist Church Pastor Walter Turner told ABC7 News. "A young man that was literally doing his job and now he's gone." An online fundraiser set up for Roberson's burial expenses had raised over $12,000 (_9,300) as of Monday. "Jemel was a gifted basketball player and musician, and his love for God and his family were at the forefront of his life," according to the GoFundMe page. "Sadly, Jemel's life was tragically and unexpectedly cut short this morning as he tried to save others from senseless violence." According to FBI data, a disproportionately high proportion of police shootings in the US involve black people.
6	Accidental Shooting	Black Security Guard Responding to Shooting Is Killed by Police	The New York Times	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/police-officer-shoots-security-guard-chicago.html	A black security guard at a bar in the Chicago suburbs was killed by the police as he apparently tried to detain a man he believed to be involved in a shooting, the authorities said Monday. Officers from several police departments had responded to reports of a shooting early Sunday morning at Manny's Luxury Lounge in Robbins, Ill., said Sophia Ansari, a spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's Office. Witnesses told the police that a fight had broken out and someone had started shooting. After the authorities responded, a police officer shot the guard, Jemel Roberson, 26, who had a gun, Ms. Ansari said. Mr. Roberson died at the hospital. Witnesses said that people in the crowd had yelled to arriving police officers that Mr. Roberson, who was wearing gear that read "Security," was a guard. Ms. Ansari confirmed that Mr. Roberson worked for the bar. "Everybody was screaming out, 'Security!'," one witness, Adam Harris, told WGN-TV. "He was a security guard. And they still did their job, and saw a black man with a gun, and basically killed him." This episode happened as many Republican politicians, including President Trump, have responded to mass shootings across the United States by calling for more people to protectively carry guns. After a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue left 11 people dead, Mr. Trump suggested that people carrying firearms during services would have helped. Ms. Ansari said that five people were shot during the episode at the bar. The injuries sustained by four of those people, including the man believed to have initially opened fire, were not life threatening, she said. An officer with the Midlothian Police Department shot Mr. Roberson, Ms. Ansari said. The Midlothian police chief, Dan Delaney, confirmed in a statement that one of his officers had shot a "subject with a gun." He did not name the officer. On Monday, Mr. Roberson's mother, Beatrice Roberson, filed a federal lawsuit against the unnamed police officer and the village of Midlothian. It alleges that the shooting was unprovoked, unjustified, excessive and unreasonable. Ms. Ansari said the man who initially opened fire at the bar had not yet been charged. She said he was still at a hospital. The shooting of Mr. Roberson is being investigated by the Illinois State Police, who did not return a call for comment. Family friends of Mr. Roberson's said he had worked as an organist at several local churches and had once dreamed of becoming a police officer himself, according to local news reports. Mr. Roberson had a state firearm owner's identification card, Ms. Ansari said, which authorized his possession of firearms. Mr. Roberson had planned to play later that day at New Spiritual Light Baptist Church, the pastor, Walter Turner, told the local ABC affiliate. "How in the world does the security guard get shot by the police?" Pastor Turner said. "A young man that was literally just doing his job, and now he's gone."
7	Accidental Shooting	Cop accidentally kills security guard at bar in Chicago suburbs: report	Fox News	https://www.foxnews.com/us/cop-accidentally-kills-security-guard-at-bar-in-chicago-suburbs	A police officer mistakenly shot and killed a security guard at a bar in Chicago's south suburbs early Sunday morning, Chicago's Fox 32 reported. Witnesses said a security guard told a group of "drunk men" to leave a Robbins bar around 4 a.m. An armed suspect later came back inside the bar and opened fire, WGN-TV reported, citing witnesses. Armed security guards returned fire, the report said. One the guards -- Jemel Roberson, 26 -- apprehended the suspect outside, witnesses said. Roberson then requested help from Midlothian Police, the Cook County Sheriff's Office said. A witness told the station that Roberson was holding the suspect on the ground when one of two responding officers fatally shot him. "The security guard that got killed, he caught somebody and had his knee on him the whole time," said one witness cited by Fox 32. "Just waiting on the police to get there. I guess when the police got there, they probably thought he was one of the bad guys, cause he had his gun on the guy and they shot him." Four other people, including the shooter, suffered non-life threatening injuries, WGN-TV reported. Midlothian police confirmed that one of its two responding officers opened fire. The officer's identity was not released. Roberson was reportedly a church organist who was training to become a police officer. "He was getting ready to train and do all that stuff,  so the very people he wanted to be family with took his life," said Pastor Patricia Hill of Purposed Church. The Cook County Sheriff's Office is investigating the first shooting, while the State Police Public Integrity Task Force is investigating the police shooting. Robbins is a sparsely-populated village about a 30-minute drive south of Chicago. The shooting coincided with another violent weekend in Chicago with 20 shot -- including 3 fatally, The Chicago Sun-Times reported. The fatalities began early Saturday when a 29-year-old man was shot at a restaurant in the city's Far South Side, the report said. On Saturday evening, a 42-year-old man died inside his South Green Street apartment when someone took out a gun and shot him during a dice game, the Cook County medical examiner's office said. A 24-year-old man on Sunday evening was shot by an unidentified gunman multiple times in the chest and abdomen, the report said. Police said at least 17 others have been wounded from gun violence since Friday evening.

Jemel Roberson, 26, was pronounced dead shortly after being taken to a hospital early Sunday following the shooting at Manny's Blue Room in Robbins, just south of Chicago. Four others were shot and wounded, including a man who police believe fired a gun before police arrived, Cook County sheriff's spokeswoman Sophia Ansari said.

He said Jemel Roberson was dressed in black but wearing a hat with the word "security" when he was shot. Kulis also echoed witness reports that Roberson was holding down another man outside the bar when the officer arrived and shot him. The Rev. Marvin Hunter said Roberson was "an upstanding young man" and a promising keyboard player at his and several other area churches.

9	Accidental Shooting	Cop fatally shoots security guard at bar in Chicago suburbs	New York Post 	https://nypost.com/2018/11/12/cop-fatally-shoots-security-guard-at-bar-in-chicago-suburbs/	A police officer gunned down an armed black security guard who tried to stop a shooting at a suburban Chicago bar, according to reports Monday. The 26-year-old guard, Jemel Roberson, had restrained a thug involved in the shooting outside Manny's Blue Room in Robbins, Ill., after gunfire broke out at 4 a.m. Sunday, according to local station Fox32.

10	Florida midterm vote recount	One Day In, Florida's Senate Recount Gets Messier	The Huffington Post	https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-recount-rick-scott-bill-nelson_us_5be8b7f6e4b0769d24ceb6c9?guccounter=1	The race to count Florida's votes got even messier on Sunday as Gov. Rick Scott's campaign filed a handful of lawsuits seeking to give law enforcement custody of election equipment and prevent certain ballots from being included in official results. A recount began Saturday in the U.S. Senate race between Scott, a Republican, and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. Scott narrowly leads Nelson by about 0.15 percentage points, well within the state's 0.25 percent threshold for a manual recount. Scott accused Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections in Broward County, of violating state law by refusing to provide information to his campaign about the number of outstanding ballots. He also alleged Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County, had run afoul of state law by duplicating and damaging certain ballots. He asked a state judge to authorize law enforcement officials to "impound and secure" all voting equipment when it wasn't in use for the recounts or other election-related activity. He also asked the judge to require both officials to preserve all ballots related to the 2018 elections. In a separate suit against Snipes, Scott's campaign asked a judge to block Broward County from counting any of the ballots it didn't include in the unofficial results it submitted to the Florida Department of State by noon Saturday, a deadline set by state law. That request, if granted, could mean some valid ballots would not be counted. Florida accepts vote-by-mail ballots until 7 p.m. on Election Day and the county may not have them all counted by Saturday's deadline. The populous and heavily Democratic Broward County is a key area for Nelson if he is to overcome Scott's lead. In a Sunday statement, Nelson's campaign accused Scott of trying to stop valid votes from being counted. "If Rick Scott wanted to make sure every legal ballot is counted, he would not be suing to try and stop voters from having their legal ballot counted as intended," the campaign said in a statement. "He's doing this for the same reason he's been making false and panicked claims about voter fraud _ he's worried that when all the votes are counted he'll lose this election. We will not allow him to undermine the democratic process and will use every legal tool available to protect the rights of Florida voters." Florida Democratic Party Executive Director Juan Penalosa said in a statement that Scott was "using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our Democracy." "In suing to seize ballots and impound voting machines, Rick Scott is doing his best to impersonate Latin American dictators who have overthrown Democracies in Venezuela and Cuba," Penalosa said. There are also recounts underway in statewide contests for governor and state agriculture commissioner. Bucher, the Palm Beach County election official, told CNN it would be "impossible" for her staff to meet the state's deadline for recounting the votes. Sarah Revell, a spokeswoman for the Florida Secretary of State's Office, told the network that if a county can't meet the deadline "then the results on file at that time take their place." The chair of the Palm Beach Republican Party told CNN that would be good news for Republicans because GOP candidates are currently leading. Nelson's campaign also has a lawsuit seeking to force the state to count ballots thrown out because the signature on them didn't match the one on file with the state's voter registration. Federal judges in Georgia and New Hampshire have blocked similar laws in those states this year. In a televised statement in front of the governor's mansion Thursday evening, Scott suggested there was "rampant fraud" in Broward and Palm Beach counties and asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate. The state law enforcement agency said Friday it wasn't investigating any allegations of fraud, but Scott continued to insist in a television interview on Fox News Sunday that such fraud existed.
11	Florida midterm vote recount	Florida Officially Orders Statewide Recount in Senate and Governor's Races	Slate	https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/11/florida-election-recount-senate-governor-race-nelson-scott-desantis-gillum.html	The two marquee races in Florida remain so tight they are officially headed toward a recount, the state secretary of state, Ken Detzner-an appointee of current Florida governor and Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott-announced Saturday. As the state begins its second tally, the original count in the Senate race gives Scott an ever-so-slim 12,500-vote lead of 8 million votes cast over Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson. That amounts to a 0.15 percent advantage. In the similarly tight race to replace Scott as governor, former Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis is out in front of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by nearly 34,000 votes or 0.41 percent. The recounts seemed inevitable as the races tightened in the aftermath of Tuesday's vote and became a certainty after the noon deadline Saturday for county election supervisors to submit their results passed with both races within the 0.5 percent margin that legally mandates a recount. In the governor's race, which stands at a 0.4 percent margin, a legally required machine recount will be undertaken. In the Senate race, because it's closer than 0.25 percent, an additional hand recount is required by law of votes that were not initially counted by the voting machines for whatever reason. Some of those may be blank, filled in partially, incorrectly, or just misread by the machine. The machine recount must be completed by Thursday at 5 p.m. "In Broward and Palm Beach counties Saturday morning, attorneys from both parties quibbled over ballots in which the intent or eligibility of the voter was in doubt as the minutes ticked toward a noon deadline," the Washington Post reports. "Officials from both parties have focused much of their ire on Brenda Snipes, supervisor of elections in Broward County, Florida's second-largest county and the site of the 'hanging chads' and other ballot irregularities during the 2000 presidential recount." The Florida Department of State has sent monitors to Broward County, which had tallied more than 700,000 votes as of Thursday afternoon, stemming from a lawsuit over the county's mishandling of 2016 congressional race ballots. Scott and, unsurprisingly, President Donald Trump have floated theories and warnings about voter fraud that have been rebutted by the Department of State, which said it had "no evidence of criminal activity at this time." Both campaigns have done what campaigns on the leading and trailing ends of too-close-to-call contests do. "It's time for Senator Nelson to accept reality and spare the state of the Florida the time, expense and discord of a recount," said Scott spokesman Chris Hartline. Whereas the Nelson campaign issued a statement calling for all the votes to be counted. "We have every expectation the recount will be full and fair and will continue taking action to ensure every vote is counted without interference or efforts to undermine the democratic process," the statement reads. "We believe when every legal ballot is counted we'll win this election." Further complicating matters in the Senate race is a potential ballot design flaw that may have caused tens of thousands of voters to skip over the Senate contest in Broward County, which was buried underneath the ballot instructions. Roughly 10,000 fewer people voted in Broward County in the Senate race than for the commissioner of agriculture or the chief financial officer race, which is unusual. If tens of thousands of voters mistakenly skipped over the Senate race, that appears to be tough luck for Nelson and something that will obviously need to be remedied in the future. Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias, however, has suggested the undervote is due to the voting machines failing to detect legitimate votes. If that is the case, then the gap will likely close substantially.
12	Florida midterm vote recount	Andrew Gillum withdraws his concession as the Florida recount is officially on for three key races	Daily Kos	https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/11/10/1811855/-Andrew-Gillum-withdraws-his-concession-as-the-Florida-recount-is-officially-on-for-three-key-races	Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee and Democratic nominee for Florida governor, has withdrawn his Election Day concession to opponent and hero to racists, Ron DeSantis. That's right: Gillum is back in the race. "I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call we count every single vote," Gillum announced on Twitter Saturday, as well as in a press conference. How is this possible? Florida is doing a recount of votes. Earlier today, Ken Detzner, Florida's Secretary of State, announced that the state was doing a recount via machine. This recount applies to races across the state. The recount will also apply to the Senate race between Republican Governor Rick Scott and Democratic Senator, Bill Nelson. A very slim margin also looms over the race between Nikki Fried, the Democratic agriculture commissioner, and Republican Matt Caldwell. How did this recount come about? Here's how it works in Florida (remember, this process varies by state). Since margins came in at under .5 percent in all three instances, all votes will be recounted by machine. This part of the process has to be wrapped up by Thursday, at 3 p.m. Additionally, if races come within a .25 percent margin, those votes trigger a recount by hand. As of now, the Senate and agriculture commissioner races both fall within that .25 percent mark. This is big news, and not just for Florida constituents. Georgia and Arizona are also fighting to get every vote counted, with particular attention on Stacey Abrams, who has yet to concede to former Secretary of State Brian Kemp in Georgia's battle for governor. Seeing what can happen in one state, even when policies are different, is definitely a source of motivation to keep fighting for voter transparency everywhere. It's also a big deal on a symbolic level, as President Donald Trump seems to think not every vote matters, as shown by his snark on Twitter: "You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia - but the Election was on Tuesday? Let's blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin!" Whether the votes come in Republican, Democrat, or other, they all matter. And they all deserve to be counted.
13	Florida midterm vote recount	Florida Begins Vote Recounts in Senate and Governor's Races	The New York Times	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/us/florida-senate-governor-votes-recount.html	Florida began the first full, statewide vote recount in its history on Saturday after authorities found that tallies submitted by its 67 counties left the contests for Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner too close to call. Recounts were also ordered in a State Senate race and two contests for the State House, a measure of the slender margins in the nation's largest swing state that have left two of the most closely watched races in the country still undecided, four days after the midterm elections. After unofficial results came in shortly after noon on Saturday, Gov. Rick Scott's edge in the race for the Senate had slipped to just 12,600 votes over the Democratic incumbent, Bill Nelson. Andrew Gillum, the Democratic Tallahassee mayor who on election night had conceded his loss in the governor's race to Ron DeSantis, rose to within 33,600 votes, and retracted his earlier concession. "Florida has never had a full statewide recount. It's about to have three," Andrew Weinstein, the national chairman of the Democratic Lawyers Council, said on Twitter. "Buckle up." The sight of grim-faced candidates, shouting protesters outside the Broward County elections office and lawyers flown in from Washington evoked memories of Florida's hotly contested recount over the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore and capped off one of the most bitterly divisive midterm election seasons in years. And Florida was not the only state still trying to determine election outcomes. In the Georgia governor's race, Brian Kemp, the Republican, was ahead of his Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, by about 63,000 votes. In Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema, the Democratic candidate in the state's uncalled Senate race, expanded her lead on Friday to 20,203 votes over Martha McSally, the Republican contender - and thousands of ballots were still to be counted. Across Florida, elections office employees already exhausted after processing thousands of ballots since Tuesday geared up for a new round of tabulations, this time with a tight deadline that requires results by Thursday. The Miami-Dade elections office will have to work around the clock, in daytime and overnight shifts, to conduct the recount, said Suzy Trutie, a spokeswoman. The office, which normally relies on six ballot-counting machines, has rented an additional four machines, scheduled to arrive on Monday from Omaha, Neb. Broward County officials said they were not prepared for the voting-machine calibration test they had planned for Saturday afternoon and were recessing until 7 a.m. Sunday, when they would commence working two 12-hour shifts a day. Mr. Scott, who has filed lawsuits against elections officials in Broward and Palm Beach Counties over the handling of ballots, made it clear he was not expecting to relinquish the seat he claimed on Tuesday night and suggested the latest results filed on Saturday had reconfirmed it. "The voters of Florida have spoken and Rick Scott was elected to the United States Senate in a close but decisive victory," his spokesman, Chris Hartline, said in a statement. He said the typical recount changes outcomes "by just a few hundred votes," and hinted that Mr. Nelson should back down. "It's time for Senator Nelson to accept reality and spare the state of the Florida the time, expense and discord of a recount," he said. Mr. Nelson showed little willingness to take Mr. Scott up on his offer. "This process is about one thing: making sure every legal ballot is counted and protecting the right of every Floridian to participate in our democracy," he said in a statement. "We believe when every legal ballot is counted, we'll win this election." In the governor's race, the Associated Press retracted its earlier call declaring Mr. DeSantis the winner. Mr. Gillum, speaking to reporters in Tallahassee, defiantly announced that his earlier concession no longer applied. He said efforts by Mr. Trump, Mr. Scott and Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican, to question the counting of votes before the tallying was complete was akin to voter suppression. "I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromising and unapologetic call that we count every single vote," he said. "And I say this recognizing that my fate in this may or may not change." Mr. DeSantis, for his part, called the results "clear and unambiguous" and said that "with the election behind us," he was planning for his transition as governor. The third statewide race now set for a recount was for the post of agriculture commissioner, between Nikki Fried, a Democrat, and Matt Caldwell, a Republican. The candidates, who saw comfortable margins diminish as heavily Democratic southern counties continued to process mailed and problem ballots, have in the days since cried fraud and filed lawsuits. Mr. Scott denounced the embattled Broward County elections supervisor, Brenda C. Snipes, who, the campaign said Friday night, still refused to confirm whether she had counted all the ballots. Dr. Snipes was forced to admit that she had inadvertently tabulated about a dozen rejected ballots, which only fueled Republican accusations that her office had botched the vote-counting process. The count was completed on Saturday. "Three days after Election Day, the vote tally continues to change and Supervisor Snipes still refuses to explain where and how the new votes came to light," the campaign said in a statement. "The public deserves a clear and direct answer." Mr. Scott urged sheriff's deputies to be on alert for any reports of vote-rigging. Secretary of State Ken Detzner formally ordered the recounts on Saturday afternoon. The new tallies were expected to begin right away in the state's largest counties, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach. Other counties could also proceed immediately, though many were expected to wait until Sunday to begin. Each county in Florida will have until Thursday to run all of its ballots through counting machines again. At that point, any race that remains within a margin of 0.25 of a percentage point or less will have another three days, until Nov. 18, to conduct a manual recount. Manual recounts seem almost certain in the races for Senate and commissioner of agriculture, which are already within that quarter-point margin. A manual recount does not mean every ballot is counted by hand. Only the votes that come up as an "undervote" or "overvote" get pulled for manual review. For example, if a voter had put a check mark next to a candidate's name instead of filling the circle out completely, a vote-counting machine could have missed it. In cases where a machine detects that a person actually chose two people in the same race, a team of election workers looks at the ballot to see if the voter's intention was clear. The person could have crossed out one candidate's name, so that ballot would likely be counted. But several issues could arise during the process. Older counting machines might be unable to conduct an unprecedented three statewide recounts simultaneously, making it impossible to meet the state's deadline. If a county is unable to complete a recount in any particular race, Saturday's unofficial results from that county would stand for that race. Brian Y. Silber, a lawyer, went through an exhaustive manual recount this summer when a Broward County judge he represented seemed to have lost on Election Day - only to wake up the next morning to find that he had taken the lead. It took two days to get a new result, he said, and that was with about a quarter of the number of ballots that now must be reviewed. "I would be shocked, really shocked, if there was evidence of fraud, conspiracy, anything illegal or evil," Mr. Silber said. "What I genuinely believe is that elections officials, for whatever reason, are not getting it done on time. That's a combination of poor management, underfunding and understaffing." The problem has been going on for years, he said. He said Republicans had a savvy - albeit misleading - strategy to convince supporters in advance that any loss would be attributable to misdeeds by Democrats. "It's really smart on the G.O.P.'s part," Mr. Silber said. "They know there is no evidence of fraud." Daniel A. Smith, chairman of the political science department at the University of Florida, said 41,000 Floridians requested mail-in ballots from overseas, so elections supervisors were simply inundated with ballots to count after Election Day. "My position quite honestly is there is very low likelihood of fraud going on anywhere," Mr. Smith said. "There is a capacity issue when so many ballots come in on Election Day." Mr. Scott claimed fraud in Broward County even though the state was monitoring Dr. Snipes's office during the election. The state's division of elections assigned two staff members to watch how the election was administered, visit polling places and observe the preparation of voting equipment and procedures. The monitors made no reports of fraud. "Our staff has seen no evidence of criminal activity at this time," Sarah Revell, a spokeswoman for the division of elections, said on Saturday. The odds that Mr. Gillum, who trails by 0.41 percentage points, and even Mr. Nelson, who is behind by about 0.15 percentage points, will find themselves on top after a recount seem low, according to veterans of Florida's presidential recount in 2000. Marc Elias, Mr. Nelson's lawyer, has maintained that a machine error might still account for fewer votes for Mr. Nelson - an issue that would only be caught in a manual recount. "Ultimately, the ballots are what they are," he said. "The votes are what they are."
14	Florida midterm vote recount	Mid-term elections 2018: Recounts descend into rancour	BBC News	https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46166980	Florida has ordered a machine recount of votes for state governor and senator following last week's closely fought mid-term elections, officials say. Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner said that as unofficial results in both races had fallen within a margin of 0.5%, a recount was required by law. The two ballots are among the most important yet to be decided. US President Donald Trump responded to the news by accusing Democrats of trying to "steal" the elections. The state's Republican Governor Rick Scott, who is standing for the Senate, also warned of electoral fraud, but neither he nor President Trump offered any evidence to back their claims. The recounts are expected to take several days, but analysts say possible legal challenges mean it could take weeks for the winners to be confirmed. Mr Detzner has ordered that all 67 Florida counties complete machine recounts for the Senate and gubernatorial races by 15:00 local time on Thursday. If a machine recount shows a difference of 0.25% or less between the candidates, the state will proceed to a hand recount that must conclude by 18 November, local media report. In the race for Florida's Senate seat, unofficial results revealed a gap of just 0.15% between the votes for incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson and Mr Scott. Democrat Andrew Gillum had already conceded the state governorship, but Ron DeSantis's lead for the Republicans later narrowed to 0.41%. After the recount was announced, Mr Gillum said: "I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote." Mr DeSantis, however, insisted that the results were "clear and unambiguous, just as they were on election night". "It is important that everyone involved in the election process strictly adhere to the rule of law which is the foundation for our nation," he added. Mr Trump had earlier said there was "a lot of dishonesty" over contested votes. Some candidates have already launched legal action. Mr Scott, who claimed victory on Tuesday, is suing officials over an election recount, while Mr Nelson is suing over uncounted ballots - and there have also been a number of protests outside the elections office. Mr Scott called on sheriffs in every county to closely monitor the recount process, tweeting: "We will not let unethical liberals steal this election! "It's time Senator Nelson accepts these results and allows the state of Florida to move forward to a better future." In one of his three lawsuits against election overseers, Mr Scott has asked a judge to impound voting machines and ballots when they are not in use. Mr Nelson responded to the legal action in a statement on Sunday, saying his rival, the state's outgoing governor, was making "false and panicked" voter fraud claims because he was afraid of losing. "If Rick Scott wanted to make sure every legal ballot is counted, he would not be suing to try and stop voters from having their legal ballot counted as intended," said the Democratic incumbent. Authorities have meanwhile shot down a conspiracy theory about ballot fraud. Florida Senator Marco Rubio was among those who retweeted a photo showing a box labelled "provisional ballots" found at a school, raising concerns about possible foul play. But election officials stated that the box contained only supplies. Mr Trump told reporters on Friday, before leaving for Paris to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, that he believed that Mr Scott had clearly won the election. The president said he would send his lawyers to Florida "to expose the fraud", calling the Nelson campaign's recount lawyer Marc Elias an election stealer. Florida has a history with close elections. In 2000, George W Bush and Al Gore faced an impasse with the presidential vote hanging in the balance amid weeks of legal wrangling. Mr Gore's fate was finally sealed by a US Supreme Court ruling that said in essence that time had run out for recounts in the crucial state, granting Mr Bush the presidency. In Georgia's gubernatorial election, Democrat Stacey Abrams is refusing to concede in her race against Republican Brian Kemp. Mr Kemp declared victory on Wednesday with a narrow lead but campaign officials for Ms Abrams have started a legal challenge to ensure all votes are counted. Her supporters have claimed that issues such as ballot machines supplied without power cables and four-hour queues unfairly helped Mr Kemp. An ongoing tally has whittled Mr Kemp's lead slightly to under 60,000 votes, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. But Ms Abrams still needs another 22,000 votes to trigger a run-off election next month, and it is unclear how many ballots remain outstanding. In Arizona, another tight senate race has yet to conclude between two US congresswomen - Republican Martha McSally and Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. With mail-in votes still being counted, Ms Sinema had widened her narrow lead to more than 30,000 votes by Sunday (1.4|%), US media report.
15	Florida midterm vote recount	Florida Senate and Governor Races Go to Recount	Bloomberg	https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-10/florida-orders-statewide-recount-on-senate-governor-races	Florida's Senate and governor's races have gone to a recount that will decide two key offices in the largest U.S. swing state, setting off outcries from Republicans led by President Donald Trump and Rick Scott, the state's governor now vying to be a U.S. Senator. The Republicans' advantage in both races has fallen below the 0.5 percent threshold required to trigger mandatory machine recounts, Secretary of State Ken Detzner said in a statement on Saturday. The move quickly drew an unfounded rebuke from Trump, who's in Paris to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One. "Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida!" Trump tweeted, offering no evidence to support his suggestion. In the Senate race, the unofficial count had Republican Scott leading incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson by about 12,600 votes among roughly 8.2 million votes cast in the Nov. 6 election. The race for governor between Republican Ron DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum was separated by about 33,700 votes, with the Republican also leading there. Election workers on Saturday evening started a mad dash to recount by machine the millions of votes, in a task that some thought would be impossible to finish by the mandated deadline of 3 p.m. on Nov. 15. Scott echoed Trump on "Fox News Sunday," alleging that "Senator Nelson is clearly trying to commit fraud to try and win this election." Scott cited a Nelson lawyer saying a non-citizen should vote and seeking in court to have fraudulent ballots counted as evidence. Nelson's campaign sent a video statement on Friday in which the senator said, "Scott is trying to stop all the votes from being counted and he's impeding the democratic process." The lawyer that Scott referenced was not authorized to object, and non-citizens don't vote, Nelson's attorney Marc Elias said. The Florida governor on Sunday sued to have voting machines, tallying devices and ballots seized in Broward and Palm Beach counties. State elections officials said they had observers in Broward County and they hadn't found evidence of criminal wrongdoing. What's more, Detzner, whose office ultimately had to order the recount, is a Scott appointee. Scott's "own Republican officials in Florida said there is no fraud," Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on CNN Sunday. The recounts will decide the fate of a crucial Senate seat and a governorship in a state that will also prove important in the 2020 presidential contest. Scott declared victory on election night, but slow vote-counting in Democrat-leaning Broward and Palm Beach counties narrowed the race to within the margin that dictates a recount. DeSantis also declared victory -- and his opponent conceded -- when the outcome appeared set on election night. Trump, Scott and other Republicans have attempted to sow doubt about the process and raise suspicions about electoral officials, especially Broward County's election supervisor Brenda Snipes, who oversaw the vote in the state's second-most populous county, which includes Fort Lauderdale and Coral Springs. Republicans said Snipes failed to provide necessary transparency as votes dribbled in and Democrats closed the margin. Pressed on ABC's "This Week" on Sunday to offer one piece of evidence that efforts are underway to "steal" the Florida election, as Trump tweeted Saturday, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway cited "boxes of votes just appearing out of nowhere" and past criticism of Snipes. Photos of ballot boxes that had allegedly been left behind were distributed widely on social media, including by leading Republicans. But Eugene Pettis, a lawyer representing Snipes, said the boxes found on the premises of voting locations didn't actually contain votes -- just supplies. Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, who oversaw Republican campaign efforts for the Senate this cycle, said on CNN's "State of the Union" that there's "clear evidence that the Constitution was violated." He cited court decisions focused on transparency and meeting deadlines, though he did not provide any evidence of fraud. "What we're trying to do is make sure that we're protecting every single vote in Florida," Gardner said. He added on NBC's "Meet the Press" that he is "going to leave it to the courts to decide how we best protect the integrity of this election." Pettis, the attorney for Snipes, said "there is no basis" for fraud allegations: "It's very important that we listen to facts and not fiction," he said. Schumer said that "President Trump and Rick Scott are so afraid of every vote being counted because they think Scott will lose if that happens, that they're interfering." Floridians also struggled to understand why there were many fewer votes cast for senator than for governor in Broward, given that they were on the same ballot and no discrepancy of that magnitude occurred anywhere else. There have been suggestions that the design of ballot might have caused some voters to miss the Senate race. If a machine recount puts the results within a quarter of a percentage point, county canvassing boards would do a manual recount. Ballots from overseas civilians and members of the military will be counted if they're postmarked by Nov. 6 and arrive by Nov. 16. The official results of a manual recount would be due by Nov. 18. Florida elections have a history of minuscule margins and allegations of improprieties at polling stations and in vote-counting. The 2000 presidential election was decided when the U.S. Supreme Court halted a Florida recount and made Republican George W. Bush the winner over Democrat Al Gore. That recount was marked by America's fixation on Florida's punch-card ballots, famed for their hanging chads, which are no longer in use. Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, in an interview Sunday on CBS's "Face the Nation,' said that Florida's history "doesn't give you a great deal of confidence" in the current situation. "It could almost always be a bit of both of incompetence and -- and the potential for malfeasance," Cruz said. But despite the widespread comparisons, much has changed in Florida since then. In addition to more sophisticated voting technology, the Florida Election Reform Act of 2001 created a mechanism to automatically trigger a recount within a certain threshold. As such, trailing candidates don't actually have to request a recount, although they could refuse one. The race for Florida's agriculture commissioner will go to a recount as well, with Democrat Nikki Fried now edging Republican Matt Caldwell by about 5,300 votes. Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor, blasted Trump and Scott's remarks about voting fraud, referring to them as part of a "chorus calling for the ending of this process." "In America, we count every vote regardless of what the outcome may be," Gillum said Saturday in an event broadcast on his Facebook page. DeSantis said Saturday in a YouTube video that the latest tallies only confirm his victory, and that he's focused on preparing his new government. Scott tweeted that "we won't let liberal activists from all over the country come to Florida and steal this election."
16	Florida midterm vote recount	Rick Scott insists he 'won the election,' as recount chaos keeps Florida races in suspense	Fox News	https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rick-scott-insists-he-won-the-election-as-election-chaos-keeps-florida-georgia-and-arizona-races-in-suspense	Florida Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott insisted Monday he "won the election" while accusing incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of trying to "steal" the race from him, amid chaotic recounts in the sunshine state's Senate and gubernatorial races. Over the weekend, Florida's secretary of state Ken Detzner announced there would be recounts in both the Senate race and the governor's race, noting that unofficial results in both races fell within the margin that by law triggers a recount. But Scott said he's confident his victory won't be overturned. "I won the election," Scott told "Fox & Friends" Monday. "I'm going to focus on getting to Washington and getting my agenda implemented." On Tuesday, Scott was projected the winner of the Senate race, but Nelson has refused to concede amid the recounts. Scott, who is Florida's outgoing Republican governor, filed two bombshell lawsuits against election officials in two Democratic strongholds in Florida-Broward County and Palm Beach County-flagging them for engaging in potentially "rampant fraud." "We won. We're going to win the recount because it's never been overturned before," Scott said Monday. "I'm going to Washington as the next Florida senator." Scott added: "Bill Nelson is clearly a sore loser. He can't stand the fact that he's not going to be elected for, what, the first time in decades. He's just here to steal the election." Meanwhile, Nelson's election lawyer, Marc Elias, said Monday that they would bring a new lawsuit this week to protect ballots that are denied due to "mail/post office delays." In the Florida governor's race, Republican candidate Ron DeSantis was announced the winner by the end of Election Day, with his Democratic opponent Andrew Gillum conceding on the night of the election. But by the end of last week, Gillum took back his concession and embraced a recount. "I am replacing my words of concessions with an uncompromising and unapologetic call that we count every single vote," Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, told reporters Saturday, though saying he is prepared to accept "whatever the outcome of this election so far as every single vote_is counted." Both Scott and DeSantis led their races after the midterms on Tuesday, but as the days went on, and more votes were counted, those leads had all but disappeared. Scott's lead by Saturday afternoon was reduced to 0.15 percent and DeSantis' was 0.41 percent. The shrinking leads quickly led to suspicions from Republicans that political shenanigans were taking place in Democratic counties that had yet to complete their vote counts. Democrats, meanwhile, have accused Republicans of trying to stop all votes from being counted. President Trump on Monday referred to Florida's election as being "massively infected." "The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!" Trump tweeted Monday. The supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County, Susan Bucher, told reporters that she did not expect to meet Thursday's recount deadline in the gubernatorial and Senate races, due to aging equipment. Florida Department of State spokeswoman Sarah Revell told Fox News, though, that under state law, if a county does not submit their results by the deadline, then the results on file at the time take their place. She added that Florida's secretary of state has no authority to grant extensions. "Supervisors of Elections are independent officials and they are responsible for deciding when to upgrade or modernize their equipment," Revell said. But Florida is not the only state hanging in limbo from last week. In Georgia's gubernatorial race, Republican Brian Kemp declared victory, though his Democratic opponent Stacey Abrams refused to concede and filed a federal lawsuit in an effort to force a runoff election. The Abrams campaign's lawsuit asked a judge to delay vote certifications in Georgia's unsettled governor's race by one day, and block counties from tossing some provisional and absentee ballots that may have minor mistakes on them. Kemp has said that it is "mathematically impossible" for the Abrams campaign to force a runoff. According to the latest tallies, Kemp is up by 59,000 votes. Kemp had 50.2 percent of the vote by early Monday. Abrams, though, has maintained that she will not concede until every vote has been counted, and pointed to the 5,000 new votes tallied over the weekend that favored her. The Washington Post reported that she would need 21,700 additional votes to force a runoff. "The bottom line is this race is not over," Abrams' campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo said in a statement. "It is still too close to call, and we do not have confidence in the secretary of state's office." Kemp was Georgia's secretary of state, but resigned from the post last week upon declaring his victory in the gubernatorial race. And in Arizona, the race to replace Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., has yet to be settled, as Democratic candidate Rep. Kyrsten Sinema increased her advantage over Republican candidate Rep. Martha McSally by more than 32,000 votes as of Sunday. "Kyrsten has now expanded her overall lead to 32,640 or 1.52 percent, meaning McSally would have to win the remainder of Maricopa ballots by 22 percent to take the lead in this race," Sinema spokesman Andrew Piatt said in a statement. "This is not plausible. Kyrsten will be declared the next U.S. Senator from Arizona." But approximately 200,000 votes remain uncounted across the state, and Arizona election officials said they would not be finished tallying votes until Thursday. More than 2.3 million votes were cast in the historic election. "The votes are still being tallied, but the latest count shows my liberal opponent has gained a slight edge. There are still more than 300,000 votes left to be counted and I can't slow down now -- Democrats certainly won't," McSally's campaign wrote in an email. "Right now, my opponent's army of attorneys are gearing up for a legal fight to defeat me and I've got to amplify my efforts to cement my victory."
17	Florida midterm vote recount	Florida Orders Recount in Senate, Governor Races	Breitbart	https://www.breitbart.com/news/florida-orders-recount-in-senate-governor-races/	Florida authorities on Saturday ordered a statewide recount in the contentious races for US Senate and governor, amid tit-for-tat accusations of fraud from the candidates - plunging the state once again into election uncertainty. Eighteen years after the Sunshine State found itself at the heart of a battle for the US presidency, it was once again in the spotlight after Tuesday's vote, which left the contests for statewide offices undecided. Florida's 67 counties had been given until midday (1700 GMT) on Saturday to submit unofficial totals. State law triggers a machine recount if the difference in a race is within 0.5 percent. Florida's secretary of state Ken Detzner issued the official order for the recounts after the deadline. After the cut-off, the Senate race between outgoing Republican governor Rick Scott and incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson was super close: Scott's lead stood at just 12,562 votes out of nearly 8.2 million cast, a margin of just 0.15 percent. In the governor's race, the latest unofficial results on the Florida division of elections website show Republican Ron DeSantis, who was backed by Donald Trump, leading Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum by just 33,684 votes out of more than 8.2 million cast, or a margin of 0.41 percent. "Machine recount indicated," the website said in both cases. In a statement, Detzner said the results of the machine recount would be due on November 15 at 3:00 pm (2000 GMT). Trump was not amused by the development, tweeting from France: "Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!" With Florida's developments raising partisan tensions to fresh highs, Trump on Friday alleged a major corruption scandal was brewing. "What's going on in Florida is a disgrace," Trump told reporters. "Bad things are going on in Broward Country, really bad things," Trump added, referring to a Democrat-heavy county where officials were slowly counting votes including absentee and provisional ballots. Scott filed lawsuits against Broward and Palm Beach counties alleging fraud after his lead narrowed. On Saturday, he urged Florida's sheriffs to "watch for any violations during the recount process as outlined in Florida law." Meanwhile, Nelson - accusing Scott of trying to suppress votes - fired back with a lawsuit of his own to block steps that would reject thousands of mail-in ballots. The recount is reminiscent of the dramatic recounts that occurred in parts of Florida after the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Those recounts were halted by the US Supreme Court, and Bush defeated Gore by 537 votes in Florida to win the presidency. Broward County was at the heart of that controversy as well. Most US political races have already been settled. But Florida is not alone. In neighboring Georgia, the Democratic candidate for governor initiated legal action to ensure all votes were counted in her contest. In Arizona, there is still no official result in a fierce US Senate battle that has Democrat Kyrsten Sinema leading Republican Martha McSally by a slim margin.
18	Florida midterm vote recount	Florida orders recount for governor and Senate races	New York Post	https://nypost.com/2018/11/10/florida-orders-recount-for-governor-and-senate-races/	Florida election officials ordered statewide ballot recounts Saturday as ferocious battles over vote tallies left Senate and governor's races there in doubt. Unofficial vote totals submitted today at noon gave Republican Ron DeSantis a 0.4 percent edge over Democrat Andrew Gillum in the governor's race, triggering an automatic machine recount under state law. Republican Gov. Rick Scott's advantage over incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson in the fight for a seat in the U.S. Senate was just 0.15 percent - 12,562 votes out of nearly 8.2 million cast. If the machine recount yields a margin of victory less than 0.25 percent, state law requires Florida to conduct a hand recount that could take weeks. In a statement issued shortly after the provisional totals were released, Scott urged Nelson to concede. "Bill Nelson's lawyer Marc Elias has previously stated that margins smaller than ours are 'insurmountable,'" Scott's campaign said. As news of the recount broke, Trump weighed in on Twitter. "Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!" he stated.
19	Synagogue shooting	The Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting and the Escalating Crisis of Hate-Fuelled Violence in the Trump Era	The New Yorker	https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/the-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-and-the-escalating-crisis-of-hate-fuelled-violence-in-the-trump-era	Robert Bowers, who opened fire at the Tree of Life Synagogue, in Pittsburgh, this morning, killing at least eleven people, was not evasive about his intent. He reportedly made anti-Semitic statements during the shooting, and just beforehand posted on Gab, a right-wing social network, about hias, a Jewish nonprofit that supports refugees. "hias likes to bring invaders in that kill our people," he wrote. "I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered." Earlier, he had suggested that he supported far-right nationalism but believed that President Trump was captive to a Jewish conspiracy. "Trump is a globalist, not a nationalist," Bowers wrote. "There is no #maga as long as there is a kike infestation." American history has been marked by acts of anti-Semitic violence, including the shootings at Jewish community centers in Kansas City, in 2014, and Los Angeles, in 1999. It has been marked, too, by mass murders in houses of worship-in recent years, the massacre of twenty-six people at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, last November, and the murder of nine African-American worshippers at Emanuel A.M.E. Church, in Charleston, South Carolina, by the white supremacist Dylann Roof. The Tree of Life shooting, however, was the second attempted hate-fuelled massacre in a house of worship within seventy-two hours. On Wednesday afternoon, a man named Gregory Bush allegedly shot and killed two African-American customers at a Kroger's supermarket in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, reportedly saying afterward, "Whites don't kill whites." Ten to fifteen minutes before, he had tried the predominantly black First Baptist Church, where he spent several minutes rattling the locked doors. The manias of mass murderers are always particular. But the massacres in Pittsburgh and Jeffersontown-and the pipe bombs sent to a dozen Democratic leaders this week, allegedly by the Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc-share some obvious common causes. They are the toxic politics of the President, and the racist, nationalist fervor that has been inflamed by his rise, and the success and the militancy of the gun lobby, which for decades has refused to acknowledge the obvious: that one way to have fewer killings is to make it harder for Americans to possess guns. Each of these is a national crisis on its own. What should be plain now is that each crisis is escalating, as is the frequency of political violence. Trump, asked about the Pittsburgh shooting, said, "If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better." The moral inadequacy is vast. Murderous acts of hate have occurred, on a national scale, several times this week. It is a tragedy that the President is not able to see them for what they are.
20	Synagogue shooting	11 Killed in Synagogue Massacre Suspect Charged With 29 Counts	The New York Times	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting.html	itic slurs opened fire inside a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday morning, killing at least 11 congregants and wounding four police officers and two others, the authorities said. In a rampage described as among the deadliest against the Jewish community in the United States, the assailant stormed into the Tree of Life Congregation, where worshipers had gathered in separate rooms to celebrate their faith, and shot indiscriminately into the crowd, shattering what had otherwise been a peaceful morning. The assailant, identified by law enforcement officials as Robert D. Bowers, fired for several minutes and was leaving the synagogue when officers, dressed in tactical gear and armed with rifles, met him at the door. According to the police, Mr. Bowers exchanged gunfire with officers before retreating back inside and barricading himself inside a third-floor room. He eventually surrendered.Mr. Bowers, 46, was injured by gunfire, although the authorities said it was unclear whether those wounds were self-inflicted or whether the police had shot him. He was taken to Allegheny General Hospital. Federal officials charged Mr. Bowers with 29 criminal counts. They included obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs - a hate crime - and using a firearm to commit murder. He also faces state charges, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation. The authorities said that he had no previous criminal history. Though a bris, a ceremony to mark a child's birth, was among the ceremonies taking place Saturday, no children were among the casualties, law enforcement officials said. The wounded included a 70-year-old man who had been shot in the torso, and a 61-year-old woman with soft tissue wounds, said Dr. Donald Yealy, chairman of emergency medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The attack Saturday morning struck the heart of the city's vibrant Jewish community, in the leafy Squirrel Hill neighborhood that is home to several synagogues, kosher restaurants and bakeries. Hours later, hundreds gathered at three separate interfaith vigils on a cold, rainy evening to mourn the dead and pray for the wounded. The assault on the synagogue unfolded on a quiet, drizzly morning, and came amid a bitter, vitriolic midterm election season and against the backdrop of what appears to be a surge in hate-related speech and crimes across America. It also took place in the wake of the arrest Friday morning of a man who the authorities said sent more than a dozen pipe bombs to critics of Mr. Trump, including several high-profile Democrats. Pittsburgh residents embraced near Tree of Life Congregation after the shooting.Calling it the "most horrific crime scene" he had seen in 22 years with the F.B.I., Robert Jones, special agent in charge in Pittsburgh, said the synagogue was in the midst of a "peaceful service" when congregants were gunned down and "brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith." "We simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American life," said Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, speaking at a news conference Saturday afternoon in Pittsburgh. "These senseless acts of violence are not who we are as Pennsylvanians and are not who we are as Americans." The anguish of Saturday's massacre heightened a sense of national unease over increasingly hostile political rhetoric. Critics of President Trump have argued that he is partly to blame for recent acts of violence because he has been stirring the pot of nationalism, on Twitter and at his rallies, charges that Mr. Trump has denied. About Saturday's attack, Mr. Trump, addressing reporters at Joint Base Andrews, said: "It's a terrible, terrible thing what's going on with hate in our country and frankly all over the world, and something has to be done." "The results are very devastating," he said, adding that if the temple "had some kind of protection" then "it could have been a much different situation." Later, speaking to reporters as he got off Air Force One in Illinois, Mr. Trump said he planned to visit Pittsburgh but he did not say when. Leaders in the United States and across the world condemned the attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said he was "heartbroken and appalled" and that the "the entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the dead." Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that criminal charges by the Justice Department "could lead to the death penalty." "Hatred and violence on the basis of religion can have no place in our society," Mr. Sessions said. "Every American has the right to attend their house of worship in safety." The massacre Saturday was at least the third mass shooting in a house of worship in three years. Last November, a gunman killed 26 worshipers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., and in 2015, a white supremacist killed nine congregants in a church in Charleston, S.C. It came amid rising anxiety about illegal immigration and in a decade that has seen an uptick in hate crimes. According to an annual report by the Anti-Defamation League issued earlier this year, the number of reported anti-Semitic incidents in the United States surged 57 percent in 2017, the largest rise in a single year since the A.D.L. began tracking such crimes in 1979. The attack also was a deep and painful blow to the Jewish community in the United States, and came just days after George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist and major donor to Democratic candidates, who is Jewish and who survived Nazi occupation in Hungary, received a pipe bomb in the mail. Also in the past week, a Senate campaign sign for Josh Hawley, attorney general of Missouri, was sprayed with a swastika.  On Saturday, the Tree of Life Congregation was holding services for three separate congregations when the gunman stormed in with an AR-15-style assault rifle, a Glock, and two other handguns, and began shooting.  Police dispatchers received the first emergency calls at 9:54 a.m., Mr. Jones of the F.B.I. said, and police officers, including a SWAT team, were dispatched a minute later. Mr. Bowers had already shot and killed 11 people and was on his way out of the synagogue, Mr. Jones said, when he encountered police officers and shot at them.  He went back into the synagogue to hide from SWAT officers who were moving in, Mr. Jones said. He was in the synagogue for about 20 minutes, law enforcement officials said.  "By the time I got there they were already starting to extract people," said Chief Scott Schubert of the Pittsburgh Police. "Watching those officers running into the dangers to remove people and get them to safety was unbelievable." Residents near the synagogue were told to stay inside their homes. Ben Opie, 55, who can see the synagogue from his backyard, said his wife was about to leave their house to do some volunteer work when SWAT officers approached their home and said there was a gunman in the synagogue. "They chased my wife inside," he said. "They just said get in the house." On Saturday night, the authorities were still piecing together a portrait of Mr. Bowers, and had searched his apartment with a robotic bomb detector and police dogs. His apartment is in a neighborhood dotted with mostly small to medium brick homes, about a 25-minute drive south of Pittsburgh in the suburb of Baldwin Borough. Representative Mike Doyle, who represents Pennsylvania's 14th District, where the synagogue is, said that Mr. Bowers had 21 guns registered to his name. Emergency responders outside the Tree of Life. Pittsburgh's public safety director described the crime scene as "horrific." 
21	Synagogue shooting	Pittsburgh shooting: Multiple casualties at Squirrel Hill synagogue	BBC	https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46002549?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c28q43x9qmzt/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting&link_location=live-reporting-story	Eleven people have been killed, officials say, in a gun attack on a synagogue in the US city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The gunman, who opened fire as the Tree of Life synagogue held a service, was later taken into custody.  President Donald Trump said "a lot of people" had been killed and injured in a "wicked act of mass murder".  The suspect, who has been officially identified as Robert Bowers, 46, was injured and is receiving treatment.  Two other people are in hospital in a critical condition, police said. Federal investigators are treating the shooting as a hate crime.  The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish non-governmental organisation that fights anti-Semitism, said: "We believe this is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States." Hundreds of people - from the neighbourhood and also all across Pittsburgh - later gathered for an interfaith vigil for the victims of the attack in Squirrel Hill.  Sophia Levin, a local resident and one of the organisers, told the BBC some people were "really sad" and the mood was "heavy".  But she added that people also wanted to be "together, not alone", and the vigil would help heal the city.  President Trump said he would visit Pittsburgh, following the attack.  On Saturday morning, worshippers had gathered at the synagogue, in the Squirrel Hill neighbourhood, for a baby naming ceremony during the Sabbath.  Squirrel Hill has one of the largest Jewish populations in Pennsylvania and this would have been the synagogue's busiest day of the week.  According to reports Mr Bowers, a white male, entered the building armed with an assault rifle and two pistols. Reports say he barricaded himself in a room at the synagogue when police approached.  Emergency services arrived at the building at about 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT), and gunshots could be heard.  Pittsburgh's Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich later confirmed Mr Bowers was in police custody and was being treated in hospital.  The crime scene was "horrific", he told reporters. "One of the worst I've seen, and I've [worked] on some plane crashes. It's very bad," he added. He said that two officers were injured in an "initial confrontation" and that a further two Swat officers were later hurt by the gunman when they entered the building. He said that no children were among the casualties.  US media said he had shouted "All Jews must die" as he carried out the attack.  Social media posts by someone with the name Robert Bowers were also reported to be full of anti-Semitic comments. Pittsburgh FBI's special agent in charge of the investigation, Bob Jones, told a press conference that Mr Bowers did not appear to be known to authorities prior to events on Saturday.  He said that any motive remains unknown but that authorities believe he was acting alone.  Mr Jones added that the investigation was "in the early stages". "We will look at every aspect of the suspect's life," he said.  Mr Bowers is receiving treatment for what has been described as multiple gunshot wounds. In the dwindling light, and with the cold autumn rain falling, hundreds gathered in front of the 6th Presbyterian church just a few streets away from the Tree of Life Synagogue.  Holding their candles, they sang the Jewish prayer of healing.  The elders in the community had wanted to wait a day before holding the vigil, but the young people said no - they wanted an immediate chance to share their grief and voice their hurt.  Fifteen-year-old Sophia Levin declared that she was a different Jew today to the one she was yesterday. Anti-Semitism, she said, had been something she thought happened elsewhere and in earlier times; but now she knew it was right here, right now.  Some of these young people have been involved in the student gun control movement that sprang up after the Parkland shooting earlier this year.  One of them, Rebecca Glickman, told the crowd that gun control was needed now more than ever.  She told me that an anti-Semite with a gun is more dangerous than an anti-Semite without a gun, so that's a good place to start.  What has been President Trump's reaction? He called the shooting a "terrible, terrible thing".  "To see this happen again and again, for so many years, it's just a shame," he told reporters on Saturday.  He described the gunman as a "maniac" and suggested the US should "stiffen up our laws of the death penalty".  "These people should pay the ultimate price. This has to stop," he said.Later on Saturday, Mr Trump appeared at the Future Farmers of America Convention in Indianapolis, saying: "There must be no tolerance for anti-Semitism. It must be condemned and confronted everywhere and anywhere it appears."  Speaking to reporters after the event, Mr Trump said the attacker was not one of his supporters, describing him as "sick".  Mr Trump has also said that the incident had "little to do" with US gun laws. "If they had protection inside, maybe it could have been a different situation."  Former US President Barack Obama voiced a different position on the ongoing gun law debate, tweeting: "We have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun."Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said in a statement that the incident was an "absolute tragedy" and that such acts of violence could not be accepted as "normal".  He said: "These senseless acts of violence are not who we are as Americans.  "My thoughts right now are focused on the victims, their families and making sure law enforcement has every resource they need."  The president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, Jeff Finkelstein, said his "heart goes out to all these families".  "Now I'm just sad. This should not be happening. Period. It should not be happening in a synagogue. It should not be happening in our neighbourhood here in Squirrel Hill," he said. Other world leaders to condemn the attack include Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said he was "heartbroken and appalled".  "We stand together with the American people in the face of this horrendous anti-Semitic brutality," he said in a video message.  UK Prime Minister Theresa May said she was "shocked" by the attack.  "Our thoughts are with the Jewish community in Pittsburgh and all those affected by this sickening and cowardly act," she said.  Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country's hearts "are with the Jewish community in Pittsburgh today".  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: "We all have to stand up against anti-Semitism, everywhere."  The New York Police Department said it had deployed officers to synagogues throughout the city as a precaution. The BBC's Dan Johnson in Washington says the shootings come at a tense time in the US, after a week in which mail bombs were sent to critics of Mr Trump, ahead of crucial mid-term elections next month. 
22	Synagogue shooting	Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect who allegedly stated aim to 'kill Jews' charged with federal hate crimes	ABC News	https://abcnews.go.com/US/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-victims-joyce-fienberg-melvin-wax/story?id=58872459	The man accused of killing 11 Jews in an anti-Semitic attack at a Pittsburgh synagogue was charged in a 44-count indictment that includes federal hate crimes. Suspect Robert Bowers, 46, "made statements indicating his desire to 'kill Jews'" in the shooting attack on Saturday, the Department of Justice said in its indictment Wednesday.  The charges include 11 counts of obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and 11 counts of use and discharge of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence.  "Hatred and violence on the basis of religion can have no place in our society," Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement accompanying the indictment. "Every American has the right to attend their house of worship in safety."  Grieving family, friends and neighbors of the 11 people gunned down at the Tree of Life synagogue meanwhile continued Wednesday with a series of funerals. Friends and family gathered at separate funerals to remember Joyce Fienberg, 75, Irving Younger, 69, and Melvin Wax, 88, who were among the 11 worshippers gunned down.  Fienberg, a former research specialist, is survived by her two sons and grandchildren. Her husband, "internationally acclaimed statistician" Stephen Fienberg, died in 2016. "My mother-in-law was one of the kindest humans I've ever met," her daughter-in-law, Marnie Fienberg, told ABC News.  Joyce Fienberg's most important relationships were the ones she had with her six grandchildren, who range in age from 15 to 8, her daughter-in-law said.  "She made a point of mastering social media very early so she could stay in touch with these kids," Marnie Fienberg said. "Each one of them had a one-on-one relationship with her. She knew what was going on in their days; she was so involved. She really was an amazing, amazing grandmother." Melvin Wax, a retired accountant, was a fixture of the Tree of Life congregation, friend Myron Snider told The Associated Press. Wax was known for being one of the few people who always showed up to services early, Marilyn Honigsberg told the AP.  "If somebody didn't come that was supposed to lead services, he could lead the services and do everything. He knew how to do everything," Snider told the AP. Wax's wife, Sandra, died in 2016.  Snider recalled that when he recently spent six weeks in the hospital for pneumonia, Wax "called my wife to get my phone number in the hospital so he could talk to me. ... Just a sweet, sweet guy." Irving Younger, a former small-business owner and youth baseball coach, was a regular volunteer and worshipper at the synagogue, where he would come early and stay late, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.  "I wouldn't be surprised if he saw this gunman walk into the room where the services were and his first thought was, 'Can I help this stranger get settled?' Until he saw what the stranger was doing -- because that's the kind of thought that he would have," said Schachter, the former congregation president. Younger was also "the most wonderful dad and grandpa,"neighbor Tina Prizner told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.  "He talked about his daughter and his grandson, always, and he never had an unkind word to say about anybody," Prizner said.  President Donald Trump and the first lady, joined by the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump, visited the synagogue Tuesday afternoon. The president placed stones, as part of Jewish tradition, and white roses on the Stars of David set up in a makeshift memorial for those killed.  Rabbi Jeffrey Myers -- who escaped the gunfire Saturday -- greeted the president outside the Tree of Life as protesters gathered nearby. Thousands of people from different faiths, apparently united in anger, marched toward the synagogue.  "Words have meaning!" some neighbors screamed toward the president's envoy.  After visiting the synagogue, the president and first lady went to a hospital where they met police officers who were wounded in the attack and medical staff. 24
23	Synagogue shooting	Pittsburgh Shooter Kills 11 in Worst Synagogue Attack in U.S.	Bloomberg	https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-27/pittsburgh-police-report-active-shooter-near-synagogue	A gunman who's believed to have spewed anti-Semitic slurs and rhetoric on social media barged into a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday and opened fire, killing 11 people in one of the deadliest attacks on Jews in U.S. history. The 20-minute attack at Tree of Life Congregation in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood left six others wounded, including four police officers who dashed to the scene, authorities said.  The suspect, Robert Bowers, traded gunfire with police and was shot several times. Bowers, who was in fair condition at a hospital, was charged late Saturday with 29 federal counts, including hate crimes and weapons offenses. It wasn't immediately known if Bowers had an attorney to speak on his behalf.  "Please know that justice in this case will be swift and it will be severe," Scott Brady, the chief federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania, said at a news conference, characterizing the slaughter as a "terrible and unspeakable act of hate."  The mass shooting came amid a rash of high-profile attacks in an increasingly divided country, one day after a Florida man was arrested and charged with mailing a series of pipe bombs to prominent Democrats and little more than a week before the midterm elections.  The killings also immediately reignited the longstanding national debate about guns: President Donald Trump said the outcome might have been different if the synagogue "had some kind of protection" from an armed guard, while Pennsylvania's Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf noted that once again "dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm's way."  Trump ordered flags at federal buildings throughout the U.S. to be flown at half-staff in "solemn respect" for the shooting victims. He said he planned to travel to Pittsburgh, but offered no details.  Authorities say that just before 10 a.m., Bower entered the large synagogue with an assault-style rifle and three handguns. Three separate congregations were conducting Sabbath services in different areas of the large building, according to Michael Eisenberg, the immediate past president of the Tree of Life. The Pennsylvania attorney general's office said it was told by victims that a brit milah - a ritual circumcision ceremony at which a baby boy also receives his Hebrew name - was also taking place, though law enforcement officials later said no children were among the dead or wounded.  "It is a very horrific crime scene," said a visibly moved Wendell Hissrich, the Pittsburgh public safety director. "It's one of the worst that I've seen."  The survivors included Daniel Leger, 70, a nurse and hospital chaplain who was in critical condition after undergoing surgery, his brother, Paul Leger, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Daniel Leger was scheduled to lead a service Saturday morning, he said.  The mass shooting raised immediate alarm in Jewish communities around the country. Authorities in New York City, Chicago and elsewhere increased security at Jewish centers.  Bob Jones, head of the FBI's Pittsburgh office, said that worshippers "were brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith," though he cautioned the shooter's full motive was not yet known.  Bowers, who had no apparent criminal record, expressed virulently anti-Semitic views on a social media site called Gab, according to an Associated Press review of an archived version of the posts made under his name. The cover photo for his account featured a neo-Nazi symbol, and his recent posts included a photo of a fiery oven like those used in Nazi concentration camps used to cremate Jews during World War II.  Other posts referenced false conspiracy theories suggesting the Holocaust - in which an estimated 6 million Jews perished - was a hoax. He wrote of a Jewish "infestation," using a slur for Jews.  Gab confirmed Bowers had a profile on its website, which is popular with far-right extremists.  Before the shooting, the poster believed to be Bowers also wrote that "HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in."  HIAS is a nonprofit group that helps refugees around the world find safety and freedom. The organization says it is guided by Jewish values and history.  Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League, said the group believes Saturday's attack was the deadliest on the Jewish community in U.S. history.  "Our hearts break for the families of those killed and injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and for the entire Jewish community of Pittsburgh," Greenblatt said.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was "heartbroken and appalled" by the attack.  "The entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the dead," Netanyahu said. "We stand together with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh. We stand together with the American people in the face of this horrendous anti-Semitic brutality. And we all pray for the speedy recovery of the wounded."  Thousands of people, some holding candles, gathered for a vigil in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood on Saturday night in honor of the victims, whose names were not immediately released. A chant of "vote, vote, vote" broke out during the emotional gathering. Some attendees blamed the shooting on the nation's political climate, and said they took little solace in the planned visit by Trump.  At a political rally in Murphysboro, Illinois, Trump said "the evil anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us."  The president - who, at times, has been accused by critics of failing to adequately condemn hate, such as when he blamed "both sides" for the violence at a Charlottesville, Virginia, white supremacist rally in 2017 - said that anti-Semitism must be "confronted and condemned everywhere it rears it very ugly head." He called for the imposition of the death penalty for "crimes like this."   The synagogue is located in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. The facade of the fortress-like concrete building is punctuated by rows of swirling, modernistic stained-glass windows illustrating the story of creation, the acceptance of God's law, the "life cycle" and "how human-beings should care for the earth and one another," according to its website. Among its treasures is a "Holocaust Torah," rescued from Czechoslovakia.  Its sanctuary can hold up to 1,250 people.  Eisenberg, the former synagogue president, said officials at Tree of Life had not gotten any threats that he knew of before the shooting. But he said security was a concern, and the synagogue had started working to improve it.  Chuck Diamond, a former rabbi at the synagogue who retired more than a year ago, said the building is locked during the week, and is outfitted with security cameras. "But on Sabbath it's an open door," he said.  "You know, you're always worried that something would happen," said Myron Snider, head of the cemetery committee for New Light Congregation, which meets at Tree of Life. Snider just got out of the hospital on Thursday and missed Saturday's service.  "But you never dream that it would happen like this," Snider added. "Just never ever dream that it would happen like this."
24	Synagogue shooting	Multiple people killed in shooting at Pittsburgh synagogue	The Hill	https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/413463-multiple-shot-killed-by-gunman-at-pittsburgh-synagogue	Eight people are reportedly dead and more wounded after a gunman opened fire at a synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday morning. Police spokesman Chris Togneri said that a suspect is in custody after being taken to the hospital, adding that there are "multiple casualties inside the synagogue."  Officials said the FBI is taking over the investigation into the shooting, which is being treated as a potential hate crime.  Togneri said that three officers were shot and police were clearing the building. The medical status of the officers who were shot was not immediately clear.   "This is one of the most horrific crime scenes I've ever seen," Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said at an afternoon press conference.  Multiple law enforcement sources told local CBS affiliate KDKA and CNN that the gunman had been identified as Robert Bowers, 46.  KDKA reported that eight people had been killed and others were wounded, including the officers who exchanged gunfire with the gunman.   Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) wrote on Twitter that he was heading to the synagogue in Squirrel Hill, adding state police were assisting local law enforcement.  "Please stay away from the area and keep the congregants and law enforcement in your prayers," Wolf tweeted.  Pittsburgh City Councilman Corey O'Connor warned residents to stay indoors, saying officers were responding to the situation.  President Trump called the shooting "devastating" and suggested that armed guards could have prevented the outcome.  "If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better," Trump told reporters on Saturday afternoon before traveling to a campaign rally in Illinois.  "This is a dispute that will always exist, I think, but if they had some protection inside the temple, maybe it could have been a very much different situation."  Trump called for the gunman, whom he described as a "madman" and "wacko," to receive the death penalty.  "I heard the police did an incredible job, and as you know, numerous police were badly injured. But, again, law enforcement did a fantastic job," Trump added. Police sources told KDKA that the suspected shooter made an anti-Semitic remark upon beginning the attack, shouting "all Jews must die" as he entered the building and opened fire.  Squirrel Hill is considered a historic Jewish enclave in the city of Pittsburgh, and is home to around a third of all Jewish residents in the city.  Police had rushed to the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue, where attendees had gathered for a Saturday service.  KDKA reported that police received calls from individuals barricaded inside the building.  CNN also reported that investigators were looking at a suspicious package on the first floor of the religious center. At a press conference Saturday afternoon, Togneri would not confirm the status of the package, but noted that no other potential packages or explosives were being investigated currently by police.

25	Synagogue shooting	Eleven dead, six wounded in Pittsburgh synagogue shooting; suspect in custody	The Washington Times	https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/27/shooting-mass-casualties-reported-tree-life-synago/	Eleven people were killed Saturday morning during a mass-shooting at The Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that ended in the arrest of a single suspect, Robert Bowers, and the recovery of multiple weapons. Six victims were wounded, including four law enforcement officials in stable condition, authorities said during an afternoon press conference. The shooter, a 46-year-old Pittsburgh resident, likewise sustained injuries.  The FBI are treating the incident as a hate crime, and President Trump said the shooter deserves the death penalty.  "Anyone who does a thing like this to innocent people _ they should really pay the ultimate price," Mr. Trump told reporters prior to heading to a farming event in Indiana.  The rampage unfolded during morning services, turning the Jewish house of worship into a gruesome crime scene the city's public safety director, Wendell Hissrich, compared to a "plane crash." "This is the most horrific crime scene I've seen in 22 years," echoed Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge at the bureau's Pittsburgh office, adding that 11 people were "brutally murdered by a gunman simply targeting them because of their faith." The Tree of Life Synagogue reported an active shooting situation at 9:54 a.m. Saturday morning, and law enforcement officers were dispatched within seconds, Mr. Hissrich said at a press conference.  Law enforcement officials engaged the suspect upon arriving, and two police officers and two SWAT officers were among the six victims who suffered non-fatal injuries, Mr. Hissrich added.  Police arrested the suspect around 20 minutes after the first shots were fired and subsequently recovered weapons including an assault rifle and three handguns, Mr. Jones told reporters.  Mr. Bowers was not known to law enforcement prior to the incident, and authorities suspect he acted alone, the FBI agent added.  "The FBI will work around the clock to get the answers to how and why this happened," he told reporters.  Located in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of eastern Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's second largest city, The Tree of Life Synagogue hosts weekly services every Saturday morning, according to its website.  An internet account allegedly operated by Mr. Bowers on Gab, a social media platform, made multiple anti-Semitic comments prior to the rampage, including as recently as Saturday morning.  "I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in," the user wrote.  The Department of Justice is expected to file charges as soon as Saturday evening.  "This should not be happening, period," said Jeff Finkelstein, chief executive of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, the main fundraising and planning organization for the local Jewish community. "It should not be happening in a synagogue. It should not be happening in our neighborhood here in Squirrel Hill," he told reporters Saturday.  "This is an absolute tragedy," said Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat. "We must all pray and hope for no more loss of life. But we have been saying 'this one is too many' for far too long. Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm's way."  Speaking with reporters on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, D.C., President Trump suggested lives could have been saved had armed security been in place.  "If they had an armed guard inside, they might have been able to stop him immediately," Mr. Trump said. "Isn't it a shame that we even have to think of that, inside of a temple or inside a church? But certainly the results might have been far better."  First lady Melania Trump posted on Twitter, "My heart breaks over the news out of #Pittsburgh. The violence needs to stop. May God bless, guide & unite the United States of America."
26	Synagogue shooting	Synagogue shooter screamed 'All Jews must die' before opening fire	The Ney York Post	https://nypost.com/2018/10/27/shooter-screamed-all-jews-must-die-before-opening-fire-at-pittsburgh-synagogue/	A gunman screaming "All Jews must die!" burst into a Pittsburgh synagogue during Sabbath services, shooting and killing at least 11 people and wounding a half-dozen more, including four police officers, before surrendering. The conservative Tree of Life Synagogue had been packed with three separate congregations attending Saturday morning services when the bloodbath began at around 10 a.m.  Congregants told MSNBC that a bris, or circumcision ceremony had been in progress.  Pennsylvania's Attorney General Josh Shapiro said the shooting happened during the portion of the ceremony when the child is given a Hebrew name.  The "shooter claimed innocent lives - and injured first responders - at a baby naming," Shapiro said.  The suspect - identified by CBS affiliate KDKA as 46-year-old Robert Bowers, a bearded, heavyset resident of Pittsburgh - was armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle and two handguns, according to multiple reports.  He had an active license to carry a firearm, law enforcement sources told CNN, and was known to have made at least six firearm purchases since 1996.  The gunfire sent congregants scattering, with many calling police after barricading themselves inside the building, located in the city's Jewish enclave Squirrel Hill. Bowers was himself injured and crawling on his hands and knees as he surrendered at around 11 a.m. after a shootout with police. None of the injured officers were likely to die, according to officials.  He surrendered "with a pistol in his waistband and one strapped to his ankle," tweeted local reporter Ross Guidotti.  "It's a very horrific crime scene. One of the worst that I've seen, and I've been on some plane crashes," Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters.  "It's very bad," he added. He declined to confirm the number of dead. The investigation will be led by the FBI in Philadelphia, and the shooting has been classified a federal hate crime, he said.  World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder called the massacre "an attack not just on the Jewish community, but on America as a whole."  In online posts, Bowers described himself right-wing, but virulently anti-Trump and anti-Semitic.  "Jews are the children of satan. (john 8:44)" he'd written on his bio on Gab, an alt-right version of Twitter on which he called himself "@onedingo."  Regarding the president, he said: "For the record, I did not vote for him nor have I owned, worn or even touched a maga hat." He railed against HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a Jewish non-profit that advocates for refugees worldwide.  "HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people," he posted hours before the shooting. "I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in."  His account was taken down shortly after the shooting, but his posts were preserved by the site Heavy.com.  President Trump decried the shooting, calling the gunman, "A madman, a wacko" and "a maniac."  Vice President Mike Pence called for the death penalty, saying, "What happened in Pittsburgh today was not just criminal - it was evil."	
27	Synagogue shooting	The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting: What we know	Breitbart	https://www.breitbart.com/news/the-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-what-we-know/	The shooting rampage Saturday in a Pittsburgh synagogue that claimed 11 lives has been blamed on a man who authorities say spoke of "his desire to kill Jewish people." Here is what we know so far about the attack, the suspect and the victims.  In a 12-page criminal complaint, police say they received multiple calls at 9:54am Saturday (1354 GMT) of gunshots being fired in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh's heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood.  The first two officers on the scene exchanged fire with a suspect carrying an assault-style AR-15 rifle and three Glock handguns, said FBI special agent Bob Jones. One officer was shot in the hand, the other injured by shrapnel.   An arriving SWAT team found 11 victims in a bloody crime scene, then followed the retreating suspect up to the third floor. He shot two officers multiple times before being taken into custody.   Two other officers were among the six people injured in the grisly attack.The suspect, named as 46-year-old Robert Bowers, is being charged with 29 federal violations, including 22 carrying the death penalty, and multiple state offenses. His first appearance before a federal magistrate is set for Monday at 1:30 pm.  Bowers, who reportedly worked as a long-haul trucker, has been linked to a rash of virulent anti-Semitic posts on social media, including one shortly before the attack that described Jews as "invaders" and said "I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered."  The criminal complaint said Bowers told a SWAT agent that "he wanted all Jews to die."   Bowers was taken to Allegheny General Hospital, where he is in fair condition, authorities said.  Bowers was licensed to carry firearms but was apparently unknown to authorities before Saturday. Police have searched his apartment in the Baldwin suburb.  A neighbor, Chris Hall, told TribLive.com that Bowers mostly "kept to himself."   "The most terrifying thing is how normal he seemed."Bowers is charged with killing eight men and three women, aged 54 to 97, all from the Pittsburgh area. They include several people who would have been children during the Holocaust and rise of Nazism.   County medical examiner Karl Williams identified them as:  - Joyce Fienberg, aged 75.  - Richard Gottfried, 65.  - Rose Mallinger, 97.  - Jerry Rabinowitz, 66.  - Cecil Rosenthal, 59.  - David Rosenthal, 54.  - Bernice Simon, 84.  - Sylvan Simon, 86.  - Daniel Stein, 71.  - Melvin Wax, 88.  - Irving Younger, 69.  David and Cecil Rosenthal were brothers, and Sylvan and Bernice Simon are husband and wife, Williams said. Reports said Cecil Rosenthal liked to greet people at the door of the synagogue before services.   Stein, who recently became a grandfather, was a regular at the synagogue, TribLive reported, part of a conservative congregation that shared space there.    Fienberg was the wife of the late Stephen Fienberg, a well-known statistics professor at Carnegie Mellon University.  Rabinowitz, a physician, was described by a patient, former deputy district attorney Law Claus, as "a trusted confidant and healer who could always be counted upon to provide sage advice," reported WPXI.com.   Five of the 11 lived in Squirrel Hill, a neighborhood with a reputation for tolerance and diversity.  Incidences of anti-Semitic harassment and violence have spiked in the US, according to Jonathan Greenblatt, director of the Anti-Defamation League.   Such incidences rose 34 percent in 2016 over the year before and another 57 percent in 2017, "the single largest surge that we've ever seen," he told ABC.
28	Synagogue shooting	Pittsburgh synagogue shooting leaves 11 dead and 6 wounded; suspect hit with multiple charges	Fox News	https://www.foxnews.com/us/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-leaves-11-dead-and-6-wounded-suspect-hit-with-multiple-charges	The suspected gunman behind Saturday's shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue, which left 11 people dead and six more injured, has been formally charged, prosecutors said. Robert Bowers, 46, was charged late Saturday with 29 federal counts of crimes of violence and firearms offenses after authorities say he carried out an anti-Semitic attack on Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath. The bloody attack brought swift condemnation from President Trump and other leaders, and inspired a grim vigil in the city on Saturday night that attracted thousands. Bowers is facing 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death; 11 of use of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence; four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer; and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. The suspect also faces a list of local charges, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.  Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said police were dispatched to Tree of Life Synagogue at 9:55 a.m. after receiving calls describing an active-shooter situation in the city's predominantly Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood.  He confirmed the 11 deaths -- none of them children. As for the injury tally, he said it did not include the shooter, who was taken to the hospital after being taken into custody.  University of Pittsburgh Medical Center officials said a 61-year-old woman was among the injured. Her injuries were described as "extremity soft tissue injuries that required cleaning in the operating room." She is said to be in good condition and recovering.  Another victim was ID'd as a 70-year-old male with gunshot wounds to his torso "involving major organs in his abdomen." He was undergoing his second operation and in critical condition, hospital officials said.  Police Chief Scott Schubert said that two police officers were hit during initial contact with the shooter and that two SWAT team members were also struck "during an engagement inside the building." He confirmed that all four law enforcement officials are in stable condition.The FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh office, Bob Jones, said that it was the most "horrific crime scene" he's witnessed in his 22-year career with the bureau. Jones said that the victims were targeted "simply because of their faith," but that Bowers' full motive was as yet unknown.  Bowers is said to have shouted that "all Jews must die" as he sprayed bullets, according to KDKA-TV. The attack took place during a baby naming ceremony on Shabbat, what is traditionally the busiest of days for synagogues.  Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said that the FBI is investigating the shooting as "a hate crime." That was reinforced on Saturday evening by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said the Justice Department intends to file hate-crime and other charges over an act he deemed "reprehensible and repugnant to the values of this nation."  Authorities believe the suspect acted alone.  "At this point we have no knowledge that Bowers was known to law enforcement before today," Jones added. Hours after the deadly shooting, thousands gathered at an intersection in the light rain to grieve for those killed and wounded.  "We'll be dealing with this for months and years," said State Rep. Dan Frankel, who represents the synagogue's district and was speaking a block away when the gunfire began. "It leaves an indelible mark."  In the afternoon appearance in Indianapolis, President Trump, who said he'd been in contact with the mayor and governor over the tragedy, called the shooting a wicked, anti-Semitic act of "pure evil."  First lady Melania Trump, like her husband, tweeted about the shooting Saturday.  "My heart breaks over the news out of Pittsburgh. The violence needs to stop. May God bless, guide & unite the United States of America," she wrote. Meanwhile, police in New York and Los Angeles said they would be deploying extra teams to synagogues and Jewish locations throughout those cities.  During Saturday night's memorial, there was no shortage of prayers and singing. There was also anger, and a "vote, vote, vote" chant broke out during an emotional gathering at which some derided the nation's political climate.  Several attendees blamed the shooting on the nation's deepening political and social rifts, and said they took little solace in a planned visit by Trump.  Governor Wolf attended the vigil, suspending a campaign bus trip after learning of the attack.
