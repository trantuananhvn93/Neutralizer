Korean leaders bond over handshakes and 'a lot of pictures',theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/korean-leaders-bond-handshakes-lot-pictures-korea-summit,"Korea summit’s positive mood appears to break 65 years of North and South animosity.
When the two men shook hands, it was as if old friends were catching up after a long separation, and 65 years of animosity and occasional spilt blood seemed to wash away in an instant.

At least that is how it appeared as the world’s newest double act – the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in – met at the world’s most militarised border.

There was no enmity as the two greeted each other at a uniquely peaceful point on the 155-mile (250km) border, and both men took great pains to ensure their meeting produced a positive appearance.

Moments after Kim crossed into the South, Moon asked when he would be allowed to visit the North and in an unscripted moment the two held hands and hopped over a low concrete barrier that marks the frontier.

The good-natured atmosphere was the best both sides could have hoped for. Kim wanted to project the image of a capable statesman on the international stage, not the youthful leader of a pariah nation. Moon ensured the day’s events were filled with symbolism that reinforced concepts of peace and unity.
The two planted a tree that dated from the end of the 1950-53 Korean war, and Seoul’s unification ministry commissioned five perfumes to be blended based on stories of elderly North Koreans who fled south during the conflict. A dinner menu was devised to highlight the leaders’ backgrounds, and delicacies from both sides were served.
In many ways Moon had been preparing for this moment his entire life. He was the presidential chief of staff during the last inter-Korean summit, in 2007, and his election marked a shift in policy towards Pyongyang after a decade of conservative presidents in the South.

After posing for photos, the pair walked along an red carpet to review an honour guard, some of whom wore traditional garb, perhaps a nod to a shared history when all Korean soldiers had the same uniform. In the face of the South Korean military band Kim was noticeably nervous, breathing heavily while standing stiff as Moon saluted his troops.

When Kim and Moon finally sat down, Kim pledged to “write a new chapter” in their peninsula’s troubled history and Moon hailed the visit to the border village of Panmunjom as “a symbol of peace not division”.
The North Korean leader’s eccentricities were also on display, serving as a reminder of his isolation and paranoia. A phalanx of bodyguards jogged around Kim’s black Mercedes limousine as he drove back and forth. A North Korean security team reportedly swept the summit room for listening devices and explosives, as well as spraying disinfectant on the chairs and guestbook.

In the afternoon, the two took a stroll on a bridge where Moon did most of the talking and Kim again appeared nervous, frequently adjusting his tortoiseshell glasses. The only smile was a quick flash for the camera, and then he returned to a deep frown that would remain for the rest of the day.

“The mood, atmosphere and chemistry was good between the two leaders, you could tell they both really wanted a good outcome,” said Duyeon Kim, a senior fellow at the Korean Peninsula Future Forum. “You can tell they shared common objectives for peace, firmly rooted in the two Koreas determining their future and not being swayed by outside forces.”

The day ended with a joint declaration promising peace and “complete denuclearisation”, but it remained to be seen how these would be achieved. After signing the agreement, Kim and Moon embraced and posed for photos with their hands held high.
Kim’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, arrived just before dinner, a further step in her husband’s effort to craft an image of an ordinary head of state, and another round of commemorative photos ensued. Even Kim remarked: “We’ve taken a lot of pictures today.”

The cultivation of a positive mood and chummy relationship was clearly meant to provide momentum to any meeting between Kim and Trump, which could take place as early as next month.

“We hope we can open a new road towards a new future, and that is why I crossed the demarcation line today,” Kim said, standing next to Moon as they announced the joint declaration. “We hope for a new era of peace, and we have reaffirmed our commitment to that.”"
A Historic Handshake,wilsoncenter,https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/historic-handshake,"There’s no denying it: This was a historic handshake. It’s the first time the leaders of North Korea and the United States — two countries that remain locked in a state of war — have held a summit. 

To see President Trump and Kim Jong Un shaking hands warmly and chatting so easily was both stunning and chilling. It’s a powerful moment that augers a change in the tense relationship between these two countries. But it also legitimizes the path Kim took to get here: Building and testing illicit nuclear weapons that have the potential to wreak unimaginable destruction.

We’re waiting to see what comes out of the one-on-one meeting between Kim and Trump, and the bilateral meeting between top officials from the two countries.

Regardless, this is a coup for Kim Jong Un, who has the world’s attention for his big live international debut.

The image of Kim shaking hands with Trump, in front of a phalanx of U.S. and North Korean flags, will be stunning for the North Koreans as well. They’ve been raised to fear aggression from the big, bad United States, and to see Kim, leader of their small, poor country, treated as an equal will fill them with a sense of pride as well as boost confidence in Kim. Kim will tell his people: I’ve not only shown you I can defend you but I’m also a masterful diplomat. 

This was by careful design by Kim and his strategists, who long saw 2018 as a year for big accomplishments: it’s the 65th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice Agreement and the 70th anniversary of the country founded by Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung.

We may not get the promises on quick and verified denuclearization that we want from the North Koreans. But we must hope that this is the start to a new relationship that will halt the destabilizing string of provocations we’ve seen from North Korea in years past."
Watch the North and South Korean leaders’ historic handshake on the Korean demilitarized zone,cnbc,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/27/watch-the-north-and-south-korean-leaders-historic-handshake.html,"The leaders of North and South Korea made history Friday, shaking hands on the heavily-fortified demilitarized zone separating the two countries in the first such summit in more than a decade.

The meeting, which comes after more than five years of missile tests and threats from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, embodied a strikingly different tone as the leaders discussed prospects for peace.

Recent weeks have seen a distinct softening in tone from the government of the northern rogue state, which has been under international sanctions for years over its ballistic missile tests, nuclear weapons development and human rights abuses. An opening of bilateral relations and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula were the primary topics at hand.

The presidents can be seen smiling and walking together, ahead of talks during which South Korea's President Moon Jae-In hoped to convince Kim ""to adopt a joint statement on the denuclearization of North Korea,"" according to one of Moon's advisors. Moon was elected president in 2017 on a promise of improving relations with the North, which have been hostile since the Korean War that began in 1950 and saw well over 1 million people killed.


North and South Korea have technically still been at war since then, as cessation of fighting was only enabled by an armistice signed in 1953 rather than a peace agreement.

""We are at a starting line today, where a new history of peace, prosperity and inter-Korean relations is being written,"" Kim said before the two Korean leaders and top aides began talks at the border truce village of Panmunjom.

But while denuclearization is a priority for South Korea and the West and Kim has recently expressed openness to discussing it, its success is far from guaranteed.

Kim Jong Un is expected to meet with President Donald Trump in May or June, and in early April met with outgoing CIA director Mike Pompeo in a secret meeting disclosed just last week."
North Korea’s leader steps across border for a historic summit,vox,https://www.vox.com/2018/4/26/17288108/north-korea-south-korea-talks-kim-jong-un-moon-jae-in-handshake,"Kim Jong Un walked across the border into South Korean-controlled territory on Friday, the first time a North Korean leader has set foot on South Korean soil since the end of the Korean War more than half a century ago.
Kim took those few historic steps ahead of a major summit with South Korean president Moon Jae-in. Kim and Moon both crossed over into the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which separates the North and South, for a handshake — broadcast live — before their official meeting at the Peace House in the South Korean border village of Panmunjom.
The ceremonial handshake presages a much more monumental announcement that could come out of the summit: a formal peace agreement in the conflict between North and South Korea, decades after combat was halted in 1953 with an armistice.

North Korea’s nuclear program will also be atop the agenda, and the outcome of this meeting will help steer and set the tone for the possible future sit-down between President Donald Trump and Kim later this spring. North Korea announced that it would freeze nuclear tests and shutter a nuclear testing site last week, and this summit will likely determine whether Kim really is expressing a willingness to denuclearize.

The White House addressed the Kim-Moon summit in a statement, saying it was “hopeful that talks will achieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean Peninsula.”

“A new history starts now”
Trump has said North Korea has “agreed to denuclearization”; that isn’t true, and even if Kim is making overtures, there’s reason to be skeptical. But as Vox’s Alex Ward explained, “Diplomacy with North Korea is hard for one simple reason: Pyongyang promises a lot but then doesn’t follow through.”

But the start of the summit between Moon and Kim offered hopeful signs toward progress, though not enough to confirm Pyongyang has abandoned its habit of reneging on promises.

Kim, writing in the guestbook of the Peace House, declared, according to Reuters: “A new history starts now. An age of peace, from the starting point of history.”
The cameras also followed the two leaders as they sat across from each other at the start of the summit. In opening remarks, each made overtures of peace and tried to mark the importance of the occasion.
Moon, in his opening remarks, said that Kim had a huge burden on his shoulders. “Comrade Kim, for the first time in our history you crossed the military demarcation line,” Moon said, according to CNN. “It is no longer a symbol of division but a symbol of peace.”

Kim echoed those lofty sentiments — and appeared to acknowledge his country’s habit of backing away from diplomatic agreements.

“The expectations are high and we have learned a lesson from previous times and even if we have good agreements and implementations don’t follow, they will disappoint people who had high expectations,” Kim said, as CNN reported. He added: “I hope to write a new chapter between us.”

North and South Korea: A Handshake that Shook the World,globalresearch,https://www.globalresearch.ca/north-and-south-korea-a-handshake-that-shook-the-world/5638846,"One of the memorable events of the Summit of Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un was the unexpected impact of the historical handshake between the two leaders. Many would agree with me that the Kim-Moon handshake shook the world. But I am asking this: “Did the handshake make the summit a success?” This paper tackles this question.

The Kim-Moon Handshake

Early morning of April 27, 2018, the world saw Kim Jong-un coming with dignity and self confidence toward Moon Jae-in who was waiting on the south side of the narrow demarcation line separating the Korean peninsula into two parts.. As soon as Kim approached Moon, the two leaders greeted each other with sincere and friendly smile and they shook hands with enthusiasm.

It was, in a way, the handshake of two giant families: the family of fifty million members of South Korea with the family of twenty-five million members of North Korea; it meant the meeting of Juche of the North with liberal democracy of the South.

It represented the victory of Koreans’ dream for reunification over the greed of the vested interest group who exploit the North-South tension for political financial gains.

The world watched the handshake with expectation and fear; the world cheered; the world shed tears

Many cried with relief because they realized that the handshake could mean the liberation from the fear of the global nuclear war which Trump and his hawkish oligarchy could have provoked.

The Kim-Moon handshake shook the world in another way. We saw that Kim Jong-un was not a monster, the image which Western media, intellectuals and politicians have been trying so hard to project.

We saw that he had frank and gentle smile; we noticed that he was a human being like us showing joy and worries; we witnessed that he was listening rather than imposing his own ideas.

The handshake shook the world by making us be aware of how we have had a very negative image of North Korea along with its leaders because of misleading and biased corporate media in the world.
So, the Kim-Moon handshake shook the world. It is fine! It is great!! But we have to ask an important question: “Did the handshake make the summit a success?” There seems to be a general consensus to the effect that the summit was a success. But how successful was it?

A summit would be a success if its objectives are right and it the objectives are attained. There are good reasons to believe that the summit objectives were right and these objectives were well attained.

The ultimate objective of the summit was, to be sure, to find ways and means to establish permanent peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula which we all wanted. For ten years from 1998 to 2008, two outstanding leaders of South Korean presidents, Kim Dae- jung and Rho Moo-hyun and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il have prepared a roadmap precisely for the peace and the prosperity through two summit declarations of historical significance, namely, the Summit Declaration of June 15, 2000 (Declaration-6.15) and that of October 4, 2007 (Declaration-10.04). Let us see then what this roadmap contained.

The Declaration-6.15

The Joint Declaration-6.15 was produced at the summit of Kim Dae-jung, president of South Korea with Kim Jong-il, supreme leader of North Korea. This Declaration had four key agreements:

(1) reunification of the Korean peninsula by the Koreans without foreign interventions,

(2) adoption of a sort of con-federal regime of governance,

(3) reunion of separated families,

(4) North-South cooperation in various fields including economic development, cultural and sport activities and promotion of North-South dialogues.

The Declaration-10.04

Now, the Declaration-10.04 signed by Rho Moo-hyun, president of South Korea and Kim Jong-il, supreme leader of North Korea had eight key agreements:

(1) faithful implementation of the Declaration-6.15,

(2) mutual respect for sovereignty and joint efforts for the reunification of Koreas,

(3) mutual non-aggression and mutual dialogue to reduce tension and conflict in addition to the transformation of the North Limit Line (NLL) into peaceful joint fishing zone,

(4) replacement of the Armistice prevailing since 1953 with a peace treaty through 3-party talk, or 4-party talk or 6-party talk,

(5) North-South cooperation for investments, resource development and promotion of foreign investment in Special Economic Zones, development of transportation infrastructure including the Gaesung-Sinuiju railroad, the Gaesung-Pyongyang Expressway,

(6) mutual cooperation for the development of various fields including culture, arts, sports, technologies and several other fields,

(7) humanitarian cooperation, especially the reunion of separated families,

(8) mutual cooperation in international affairs.

The Panmunjom Declaration (Declaration-4.27)

The Panmunjom Declaration signed by Moon Jae-in, president of South Korea and Kim Jong-un, chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) on April 27, 2018 (the Declaration-4.27) was a further elaboration of the two preceding declarations adding a few new agreements. This Declaration has three chapters with several sections in each chapter

In the preface of first chapter, the Declaration emphasizes, in the strongest terms, the importance of the “blood relation” of the two peoples. This aspect of biological link is perhaps the most important part of the whole declaration. Put it differently, this relation means that the two peoples are “one”. This oneness of Koreans who have been cruelly separated by foreign powers has been the theme cultivated throughout the PyongChang Olympics and the Moon-Kim summit. We will see this in greater detail below.
The Panmunjom Declaration (Declaration-4.27)

The Panmunjom Declaration signed by Moon Jae-in, president of South Korea and Kim Jong-un, chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) on April 27, 2018 (the Declaration-4.27) was a further elaboration of the two preceding declarations adding a few new agreements. This Declaration has three chapters with several sections in each chapter

In the preface of first chapter, the Declaration emphasizes, in the strongest terms, the importance of the “blood relation” of the two peoples. This aspect of biological link is perhaps the most important part of the whole declaration. Put it differently, this relation means that the two peoples are “one”. This oneness of Koreans who have been cruelly separated by foreign powers has been the theme cultivated throughout the PyongChang Olympics and the Moon-Kim summit. We will see this in greater detail below.
The messages presented in the six sections of the first chapter may be summarized in this manner.

First, the two peoples have a common destiny and they should fully implement the projects defined in the two preceding Declarations.

Second, both sides should hold sustained North South dialogues at all levels.

Third, in order to facilitate the implementation of mutual cooperation, liaison offices should be established in North and South in various fields of activities.

Fourth, North-South human networks organized through visits, exchanges and contacts are encouraged so that cooperation can be facilitated. The creation of unified sport teams is also encouraged to participate at international sport events.

Fifth, the inter-Korea Red Cross meetings are encouraged to organize as soon as possible (August, this year) the reunion of families who were separated because of the Korean War.

Finally, in the sixth section of the first chapter, the implementation of the agreements of the Declaration-10.04 is emphasized, in particular, the construction of highways and railways in North Korea and other projects for economic development

The second chapter of the Declaration-4.27 addresses the issue of military tension. It has three sections.

First, the DMZ will be transformed into a peace zone. For this, the noisy propaganda broadcasting through giant loudspeakers will be stopped. In fact, on April 30th, the removal of whole loud speakers started.

Second, the NLL zone will become, finally, a neutral fishing zone where fishing boats from North and South will catch fish in peace.

Third, liaison offices will be established in North and South in order to facilitate cooperation.

Finally, the third chapter of the Declaration has four sections.

First, both sides reaffirm the non-aggression previously agreed upon.

Second, both agreed to carry out disarmament which will be phased out over a given period of time.

Third, this year (2018) which is the 65th anniversary year of the 1953 Armistice Agreement should be made a year ending the Korean War and producing a peace treaty through multilateral meetings so that, at last, permanent peace can prevail on the Korean peninsula.

In the Declaration-4.27, the fourth section of the third chapter deals with the issue which is perhaps the most difficult part, for it deals with issue of denuclearization. The text reads as follows:

“South and North Korea confirmed the common goal of realizing, through complete denuclearization, a nuclear free Korean peninsula. South and North Korea shared the view that the measures initiated by North Korea are very meaningful and crucial for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and agreed to carry out their respective roles and responsibilities in this regard. South and North Korea agreed to actively seek the support and cooperation of the international community for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”

Here, we see two key messages.

First, the initiative of denuclearization was made by Kim Jong-un showing that Pyongyang is sincere regarding denuclearization. The Declaration-4.27 did not elaborate further the denuclearization issue, for it is an issue which should be handled at the coming Washington-Pyongyang summit

Second, we should pay attention to the expression “complete denuclearization” in the above quotation. Many people wonder if this meant the CVID (complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization) solution.

The Pyongyang’s post-summit statements seem to imply precisely the CVID solution. Pyongyang has promised to destroy completely the 7 nuclear test sites of Pyungge-ri. It appears that Mike Pompeo, new Secretary of State of the U.S. and Kim Jong-un would have agreed the full inspection of all nuclear facilities and missile launch sites in North Korea.

Coming back to the question regarding the success of the Kim-Moon summit, it can be said that it was a great success, for it integrated fully the projects specified in the two previous summits. The Kim-Moon summit did more; it implemented already some of the projects including the removal of loud speakers along the DMZ. Furthermore, there were, in Declaration- 4.27, several important new issues added. In particular, the idea of peace treaty and complete denuclearization are meaningful additions.

Oneness

If there is a very special thing in the Declaration-4.27, it is its theme. The theme underlying the whole declaration was the idea of “oneness” of the Koreans whether they are North Koreans or South Koreans. This notion of oneness has two important implications.

On the one hand, Koreans-whether they are in North or in South- are related through blood, language, culture; oneness transcends ideologies or political systems; it means that the two Korean peoples have the common destiny, that is, they live together or die together. This notion of the common destiny goes long way in implications. For instance, they are to be united in dealing with international affairs. Thus, it will be interesting to see how “oneness” will affect Koreas’ relations with China, Japan and the United States and Russia.

To understand the dynamics of Koreans’ oneness, we have to go back to the time of PyongChang Olympics. We were quite moved by how the North-South united woman hockey team entered, during the opening ceremony, by waving the symbol of the unity (oneness) represented by the blue colour map of the Korean peninsula. What the map represented was the idea that the North Koreans and the South Koreans were ” ONE”.

The cheer leader group composed of orchestra, singers and dancers shouted with the South Korean crowd:

“Oori-neun-ha-na-da” (We are One!)

The famous musical group Sam-ji-yeon of North Korea which presented a remarkable concert in Gang-neung city and Seoul included many South Korean songs in order to show that the Koreans are one through music and culture.

On April 1 and 2 the South Korean musical group went to Pyongyang and sang songs suitable for the concert theme: “We are One.” The beautiful harmony of incredible voices of singers from the North and the South made the Korean audience feel the “oneness.”

The theme of being one is repeated and even emphasized by the two summit stars, Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in.

They planted a pine tree, in the site of the summit, covering the tree with soil from Mt. Baekdu-san in the North and soil from Mt. Halla-san in the South.

They watered it with water from Han River of South Korea and Dae-dong River of North Korea.

The ideology of oneness means that North Koreans and South Koreans have the common destiny sharing pains and joy and fighting side by side common enemies.

However, in order that the oneness works, both Koreas should exercise fully their sovereignty in all areas of national life, especially in national defence.

Unfortunately, as pointed out in several occasions by Professor Michel Chossudovsky (see North Korea and the Danger of Nuclear War. The Demilitarization of the Korean Peninsula, Toward a Peace Agenda, Global Research, April 27, 2018) South Korea is the only advanced country of respectable size without full sovereignty in affairs of national defence.

South Korean armed forces are integrated into what is called “Combines Forces Command (CFC)” composed of South Korean and U.S. armed forces under the command of a U.S. general. Moreover, under the regime of Operation Control (OPCON) in times of war, it is the Americans who direct the war. It is clear that as long as this regime lasts, it is nearly impossible for Koreas to act as sovereign nation.

To sum up, the Kim-Moon summit was a great success for the following reasons.

First, it not only faithfully integrated all the North-South agreements contained in the two previous Declarations: Declaration-6.15 and the Declaration-10.04 but also it went further by adding new agreement identifying concrete measures needed for mutual non aggression and peace.

Second, the summit has produced surprising results related to denuclearization; the summit agreed to do “complete denuclearization” the roadmap of which will be determined at the long waited Trump-Kim summit.

Finally, we may add, as another contributing factor of the success, the personalities of the three stars. It appears that the courage, self-assurance and boldness of Kim Jong-un, the extraordinary diplomatic ability of Moon Jae-in and the aggressive bargaining talent of Donald Trump have all contributed to the success.

But, the most convincing contributing factor was, as far as I am concerned, the feeling and the conviction of “oneness” of South Koreans and North Koreans.

In the future, this conviction will make it possible for the two Koreas to go over differences in ideologies and political systems and to be united in the pursuit of peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula."
Tourists in Korea are mimicking Kim Jong Un's historic handshake with South Korea's president,businessinsider,http://uk.businessinsider.com/north-korea-kim-jong-un-handshake-with-moon-jae-in-tourists-2018-5?r=US&IR=T,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in has sparked a new trend: tourists are mimicking the historic handshake between the two leaders.

Images of Kim and Moon shaking hands in late April were seen around the world and now tourists are doing their best to reenact the meeting at a replica of Korea's Truce Village, which is located at a movie set not far from Seoul, the South Korean capital. The site was built for the film ""JSA: Joint Security Area,"" which was released in 2000. 

Those who want to visit the site to reenact the famous handshake will need to hurry, however, as the site is reportedly closing by the end of the month. 

At the summit in late April, Kim and Moon pledged to work toward the total denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and to sign a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War, which has technically been ongoing since the fighting stopped via an armistice in 1953. 

North and South Korea have made major strides diplomatically in recent months after communicating for the first time in roughly two years. In 2017, Kim's regime conducted a slew of missile tests, enraging the international community and raising tensions with both South Korea and the US to new heights. The situation has shifted drastically in 2018, however, as evidenced by Kim and Moon's meeting. 

Kim is also set to meet with President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12 to discuss the rogue state's nuclear program. "
"With hug and handshakes, North Korea's smiling Kim lightens summit mood",reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-southkorea-scene/smiles-and-handshakes-open-korea-summit-north-korea-kim-enlightens-mood-idUSKBN1HY08M,"SEOUL (Reuters) - The golden doors on the stately North Korean building swung open and leader Kim Jong Un, in a black Mao suit and surrounded by a gaggle of officials, descended steps towards the border.

Not since the 1950-53 Korean War had a North Korean leader set foot on South Korean soil.

With a smile, Kim stretched out his hand toward a waiting, and smiling, South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who stood between the squat, blue buildings that straddle the border at Panmunjom.

The village is one of the few places where there are no barbed wire fences or minefields between the two countries, separated by a conflict that ended with a truce, not a treaty, in 1953, meaning they are still technically at war.

“I was excited to meet at this historic place and it is really moving that you came all the way to the demarcation line to greet me in person,” Kim said as he grasped Moon’s hand across the border.

“It was your big decision to make it here,” said Moon, dressed in a dark suit and light blue tie, who invited Kim to step over the line in the pavement, which he did.

That’s something Kim’s grandfather, the North Korean regime’s founding leader Kim Il Sung, or his father, Kim Jong Il, never did.

Two previous summits between leaders of the Koreas, in 2000 and 2007, were in Pyongyang, the North’s capital.
Shaking hands again, Moon, 65, and Kim, 34, turned to face photographers in the North, and then the South, before Kim grabbed Moon’s hand and, in an unplanned move, invited him to step across the border into the North, where they stood face-to-face to talk a bit more.

Kim said he felt a “swirl of emotion” as he walked the short distance to the border, wondering “why it took so long”, he told Moon later, at the beginning of their meeting.

‘WORLD IS WATCHING’
Later, as the afternoon sun set, the two men sat at a small table on a blue footbridge along the border for a half-hour private chat, at turns laughing and looking serious - an extraordinary scene given the tension just months ago, as a defiant North conducted missile and nuclear tests.

Since January, relations have improved. Their Olympic teams march together under a common flag at February’s winter games in South Korea.

As the two men started their meeting in the Peace House on the southern side of the border, both seemed aware of the gravity of the occasion.

“The whole world is watching” with high expectations, Moon said. “We have a lot on our shoulders.”

He said Kim’s crossing of the border had transformed Panmunjom into a “sign of peace, not a sign of division”.

Kim responded with equal optimism.

“With determination, we will be heading toward a better place to make up for the lost 11 years,” he said, referring to the last summit.

Their two-hour morning meeting was marked with laughter and some banter, as well as more serious discussion, behind closed doors, officials said.

‘HIGH HOPES’
At one point, Kim said he heard Moon was “always waking up early” because of North Korea’s missile tests - which usually occurred in the morning - and promised not to interrupt his sleep anymore, presidential spokesman Yoon Young-chan told reporters.

Kim mentioned the contentious issue of North Korean defectors - who are routinely denounced in North Korean media as “human scum” - and even referred to the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, which North Korean forces shelled in 2010, killing four people.

“Coming here, I saw people are having high hopes for the summits – including ... defectors and residents of Yeonpyeong Island – those who used to worry about North Korea’s missiles coming to them at any time,” Kim said, according to Yoon.
Kim said he had heard good things about a South Korean high-speed train built for the Winter Olympics, and expressed concern that North Korea’s traffic system would “cause inconvenience” should Moon visit.

The two men went back to their separate sides for lunch, Kim driven in a black limousine and escorted by a dozen bodyguards in dark suits and ties jogging alongside the vehicle.

In the afternoon, they planted a memorial tree and watered it with water from rivers in the South and North, before walking into a small glen along the border and across the blue footbridge for their private tete-a-tete.

Afterwards, they strolled back to the Peace House, seemingly engrossed in conversation with no officials nearby.

With a joint declaration and a bear hug, Kim and Moon sealed their talks to end the Korean War within the year and commit to complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula - without offering specifics.

Wrapping up the day at an evening banquet with thumping live music, Kim made a toast with a glass of traditional Korean liquor.

“Today’s meeting and accomplishment is just the beginning and nothing more than a tip of the iceberg compared to what we have to do ahead,” he said.

“Let’s end the history of confrontations and mistrust between the North and the South, hold hands together and boldly move forward for the future of our people.”"
Photo of historic handshake between North and South Korea goes viral,washingtonpost,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/09/photo-of-historic-handshake-between-north-and-south-korea-goes-viral/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.383a551497f9,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — It was a moment that was unimaginable on Monday. But on Friday, it was reality.

The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, shaking hands with a member of North Korean royalty, “First Sister” Kim Yo Jong. Both of them with smiles on their faces. Both of them speaking their shared language.

Both of them making a point to the outside world.

Moon wanted to use the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang as a way to engage with North Korea, to show the world — and the United States in particular — that old-fashioned diplomacy still has a role to play, even with Kim Jong Un's belligerent regime.

And for her part, Kim Yo Jong, the North Korean leader's younger sister, seemed to be saying: See, we're not that scary. We can cooperate with those who aren't threatening to rain “fire and fury” down upon us.

[Who is Kim Yo Jong? Here’s what we know about the North Korean ‘princess.’]

The photo of Moon and Kim Yo Jong in animated greeting quickly went viral in South Korea, a glimmer of what could be.

Because of the tiered seating, Moon is standing below Kim — which means he is literally looking up to her. In terms of both diplomatic protocol and Korean custom, that’s a win for Kim.

Kim was attending the Opening Ceremonies together with Kim Yong Nam, who is 90 years old and is technically North Korea's head of state, although all power rests with the “great leader” Kim Jong Un. Their attendance came as something of a last-minute surprise, the result of a rapidly unfolding series of events that began Jan. 1. Kim delivered a New Year's Day address offering “detente” and setting in motion the chain of events that led to the isolated nation sending about 500 North Koreans, including 22 athletes, to the Olympics.

But it was Kim Yo Jong who is the object of most South Korean fascination. She is the first member of North Korea's ruling Kim family to travel to South Korea. At about 30 years, old she is young and clearly has her brother's trust.
South Korean television networks broadcast live coverage of the North Korean jet's arrival at the Incheon airport, west of Seoul, on Friday afternoon. From then on, cameras documented Kim's every gesture and her every move.

They caught her wide, relaxed smile when she gestured to Kim Yong Nam to take the most senior seat in a meeting room at the airport when they sat down with South Korean officials.

They documented her transfer to the new high-speed train — complete with super-fast WiFi, of course — connecting the airport and the Olympics site. And they were waiting when she disembarked at Jinbu station, surrounded by the kind of paparazzi throng and security detail that are usually the preserve of K-pop stars.
Kim Yo Jong didn't attend the reception for VIPs before the Opening Ceremonies, but she was in the VIP box for the big event, dressed in a black coat and hat. It was the kind of no-frills, I-mean-business attire that she wears in North Korea, where she works for her brother. Her ID badge around her neck showed the official photo of her that was released last year when she was elevated to North Korea's powerful Politburo.

She happily accepted Moon's warm greeting, and she stood and clapped when the unified Korean team entered the stadium.

If North Korea sees this as a charm offensive, it could hardly have picked a better ambassador."
Koreas summit: Will historic talks lead to lasting peace?,bbc,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43932032,"Friday's dramatic meeting between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his North Korean counterpart, Chairman Kim Jong-un, represents an unambiguous historic breakthrough at least in terms of the image of bilateral reconciliation and the emotional uplift it has given to South Korea public opinion.

Whether the agreement announced at the meeting - the new Panmunjeom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula - offers, in substance, the right mix of concrete measures to propel the two Koreas and the wider international community towards a lasting peace remains an open question.

The symbolic impact of a North Korean leader setting foot for the first time on South Korean soil cannot be underestimated.

Mr Kim's bold decision to stride confidently into nominally hostile territory reflects the young dictator's confidence and acute sense of political theatre and expertly executed timing.
His clever, seemingly spontaneous gesture to President Moon to reciprocate his step into the South by having him join him for an instance in stepping back into the North was an inspired way of asserting the equality of the two countries and their leaders.

It also, by blurring the boundary between the two countries, hinted at the goal of unification that both Seoul and Pyongyang have long sought to realise.

The rest of the day was full of visual firsts and a set of cleverly choreographed images of the two leaders chatting informally and intimately in the open air - deliberately advancing a powerful new narrative of the two Koreas as agents of their own destiny.

Handshakes, broad smiles and bear hugs have amplified this message of Koreans determining their own future, in the process offsetting past memories of a peninsula all too often dominated by the self-interest of external great powers, whether China, Japan, or more recently, during the Cold War, the United States and the former Soviet Union.
The two leaders' joint statements before the international media were another pitch perfect moment for Mr Kim to challenge the world's preconceptions.
In an instance, Mr Kim's confident and relaxed announcement to the press dispelled the picture of a remote, rigid, autocratic leader in favour of a normal, humanised statesman, intent on working to advance the cause of peace and national reconciliation.

A cynic might see this as both a simple propaganda victory for Mr Kim, and also his attempt to lock in place the nuclear and missile advances the North has already achieved by calling for ""phased…disarmament"" - by intentionally downplaying the expectation of immediate progress while emphasising the need for step-by-step negotiations.
The joint declaration echoes the themes of past accords, including the previous Korean leaders summits of 2000 and 2007, and an earlier 1991 bilateral Reconciliation and Non-Aggression agreement.

Plans to establish joint liaison missions, military dialogue and confidence building measures, economic co-operation, and the expansion of contact between the citizens of the two countries have featured in earlier agreements.

However, Friday's declaration is more specific in its proposals, with the two countries pledging, for example, ""to cease all hostile acts against each other in every domain, including land, sea and air…"" and providing a series of key dates for the early implementation by both sides of a raft of new confidence building measures.

These include the cessation of ""all hostile acts"" near the demilitarised zone by 1 May, the start of bilateral military talks in May, joint participation by the two Koreas in the 2018 Asian Games, the re-establishment of family reunions by 15 August, and, perhaps most importantly of all, a return visit to the North by President Moon by as soon as the autumn of this year.

Committing to early, albeit incremental, steps in the direction of peace, appears to be motivated by the Korean leaders' wish to foster an irresistible sense of momentum and urgency.

The declaration also calls for future peace treaty talks involving the two Koreas, together with one or both of China and the US.

The logic of binding external actors into a definite - but evolving - timetable for progress on key issues is that it lowers the risk of conflict on the peninsula - something both Koreas are keen to avoid and which they have long had reason to fear given the past bellicose language of a ""fire and fury"" Donald Trump.

Playing for time is a viable option, given that President Moon is at the start of his five-year presidency - a marked contrast to the summits of 2000 and 2007, when the respective leaders of the South, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, were already well into their presidential terms.

Mr Moon can count, therefore, on repeat meetings with Mr Kim, and the two men appear genuinely interested in sustaining their dialogue and making progress on the wide-ranging set of initiatives included in the declaration.

Mr Kim's own statements at the summit have also been a vocal argument in favour of identity politics, given his stress on ""one nation, one language, one blood"", and his repeated rejection of any future conflict between the Koreas - two themes that will have played well with a South Korean public that traditionally is sympathetic to a narrative of self-confident, although not necessarily strident, nationalism.

For all of the stress on Koreans determining their common future, there is no escaping the decisive importance of the US.

The much anticipated Trump-Kim summit in May or early June will be critical in testing the sincerity of the North's commitment to a peaceful settlement.

Pyongyang's professed commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to be very different from Washington's demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament.

Not only will the Trump-Kim summit be a way of measuring the gap between the US and North Korea on this issue; it will also be an important opportunity to gauge how far the US has developed its own strategy for narrowing the differences with the North.

President Moon has cleverly and repeatedly allowed Mr Trump to assume credit for the breakthrough in inter-Korean relations, recognising perhaps that boosting the US president's ego is the best way of minimising the risk of war and keeping Mr Trump engaged in dialogue with the North.

Whatever the long-term, substantive outcome from the Panmunjeom summit, the event has memorably showcased the political astuteness, diplomatic agility and strategic vision of both Korean leaders.

The dramatic events of Friday are a reminder that personality and leadership are key ingredients in effecting historical change, sometimes allowing relatively small powers to advance their interests in spite of the competing interests of larger, more influential states.
